Friends,
You have studied ‘History and Civics’ from Std. III to Std. V as a part of 
‘Environmental Studies’. From Std. VI History and Civics are included in the 
syllabi independently. Starting from Std. VI, these subjects appear as two separate 
sections of a single textbook. We are very happy to hand over to you, the ‘History 
and Political Science’ textbook for Std. Ten.
The book is written with a view to ensure that students find the book easy to 
understand and enjoyable. We wish that along with gaining knowledge, you should 
also feel happy while studying. You will find coloured pictures added with this 
purpose in mind. So, read the lessons very carefully. If you have difficulty in 
understanding any part of the book, request your teachers and parents to explain 
it. The additional information appearing in special frames is meant to enhance 
your knowledge. Audio-visual material can be accessed through ‘App’ by using 
the Q.R.Code. This would certainly help you in your studies. If you make history 
your friend and study the book, you will definitely develop a deep interest in the 
subject.
In this book, you will learn about ‘Applied History’ in the history section. 
Many people find interest in history as an exciting subject and a hobby. However, 
many have doubts about the necessity of including it in the school syllabi; 
availability of professional opportunities; if a student chooses to specialise in the 
subject, its usefulness in the student’s chosen field of career; etc. It is difficult to 
clear these doubts as there is a lack of enough information. This textbook provides 
this information. All aspects of the day-to-day life, all occupations and crafts have 
a particular history of their development. This textbook highlights the fact that 
knowledge of such history is useful in the enhancement of an individual’s 
occupational skills.
The section of ‘Political Science’, is about the ‘Constitution of Indian’. 
Information regarding elections, the process of conducting them, main political 
parties at national and regional levels, their agenda, political and social movements 
that lead to healthy democracy and challenges faced by the Indian democracy is 
included in this book. Students of Std. Ten will soon be getting a right to vote. 
This information will prepare them for fulfilling this new role capably.

History is an awe-inspiring subject and many take it up as a hobby. However, many 
feel anxious about the need to include it in the school syllabi, career prospects if one chooses 
to specialise in it or if it would add value to one’s qualifications in his chosen field of 
career. Not enough information is available to help in overcoming this anxiety.
So far, courses in ‘Method of History and Historiography’, ‘History of Historiography’, 
etc. were offered to students only at college and university level. They did not form a part 
of the school syllabi. Hence, two lessons in this book are devoted to historiography. While 
doing so the possible lack of clarity in student’s mind about the scientific method of history, 
is taken into consideration.
History is not confined to narrating the stories of various dynasties and the battles fought 
by them or the stories of great warriors. From time to time, the history textbooks have strived 
to create awareness of this fact among school-going students. However, they did not have 
any opportunity to learn about the larger scope of history beyond political history and the 
relation of history with the present. The Std. Ten history syllabus is drawn with a special 
focus on this aspect. The lessons are also arranged with this view.
Indeed, the day-to-day human transactions and history are closely related. A new branch 
of knowledge known as, ‘Applied History’ or ‘Public History’ has been developing since few 
decades. Universities in many countries are offering various courses in this field. This textbook 
tells us about this new discipline, as also about several available opportunities to professionals 
to enhance their qualifications by studying history and the increasing need for expert historians. 
The book also contains information about various courses in applied history and the institutions, 
which offer such courses.
May it be about the day-to-day transactions or about occupational skills; every field has 
its own history. Knowledge of such history helps in the enhancement of one’s professional 
skills. This textbook strives to make this co-relationship between history and various 
professional fields.
The students on the verge of starting college education face various questions regarding 
the choice of graduate programmes and proper decision making for selecting a career. 
Especially, students who aspire to specialise in history find very few informative inputs, which 
will guide and encourage them. This textbook has tried to overcome this shortcoming. It 
includes interesting information and suitable illustrations with this purpose in mind.
The scope of school syllabi of ‘Civics’ and ‘Political Science’ is very exhaustive, which 
includes an array of topics starting with the introduction of social-political environment to 
international diplomatic relations and various political processes at national level. You will 
indeed fulfill the learning objectives while studying and teaching the textbook. However, it is 
also anticipated that the class interaction should not be limited to mere information. They 
should be linked with day-to-day events and happenings. There is no doubt that the Indian 
democracy is faced with many challenges but at the same time there are many traditions 
emerging, which would strengthen it. They can be taught objectively with the help of 
discussions and dialogues. For this to happen, opportunities should be made available to 
students forming small groups. 
The structure of this textbook will expose students to newer fields of knowledge. We 
believe that the teachers and parents would receive this book with full support.

1.4 Notable Scholars   
Historical research, writing and studies 
are carried out with an objective of 
understanding the chronology of the past 
events and their interconnections. This is 
a continuous process.  
In the physical and natural sciences 
the empirical method (laboratory method 
of experiments and observation) is used 
to verify the available knowledge. This 
method allows formulating laws that 
remain true irrespective of the time and 
space. Those laws can be tested and 
proved repeatedly.  
In historical research it may not be 
possible to use the method of laboratory 
experiments and observation. This is so 
because we were not present in the 
historical time and space and the historical 
events cannot be recreated. Also in history 
it is not possible to formulate laws that 
remain true irrespective of the time and 
space.  
To begin, we need an expert who 
knows the language and script of a 
historical document in order to read it 
and understand its meaning. Also, the 
experts can examine the authenticity of 
the document by using criteria such as 
lettering style, author’s style of writing, 
manufacturing date and type of paper, 
stamps of authority, etc.  Such a document 
is further scrutinised by a historian with 
the help of relevant historical references.

(1) Its method is based on scientific 
principles. It begins with the formation of 
relevant questions. 
(2) These questions are anthropocentric. 
It means that these questions are about the 
deeds of the members of ancient human 
societies of a particular period. History 
does not suggest any interrelation between 
the Divine and human deeds.  
Methods of various disciplines are 
useful in historical research. For example, 
Archaeology, Archival Science, 
Manuscriptology, Epigraphy (Study of 
inscriptions), Analysis of lettering style, 
Linguistics, Numismatics (Study of coins), 
Genealogy (Study of lineage), etc. 
1.1 Tradition of Historiography 
We have learnt about the historical 
research method, critically examining the 
historical sources and writing the historical 
narrative. The writing of critical historical 
narrative is known as ‘Historiography’. A 
scholor who writes such a narrative is a 
historian.
The historian cannot include every 
past event in his narrative. The inclusion 
and interpretation of historical events by 
the historian often depends on the 
conceptual framework adopted by him. 
His style of writing is determined by that 
conceptual framework. 
The tradition of writing historical 
narrative, that is historiography, was not 
prevalent in the ancient societies of the 
world. However, that does not mean that 
they were not aware of the historical time 
or were not eager to know about it. 
Ancient people also felt the need of 
passing on the stories of the life and 
valour of the ancestors to the next 
generation. Ancient communities all over 
the world used various means like cave 
paintings, story-telling, singing songs and 
ballads, etc. for this purpose.  These 
traditional means are looked upon as the 
sources of history in the modern 
historiography.          
1.2 Modern Historiography
Four main characteristics of modern 
historiography : 
Do you know ?
The above picture shows a 
fragment of the earliest inscription. 
A forward marching file of soldiers 
holding shields and spears is seen 
here. The General is in the front. 
The tradition of recording 
historical event can be traced back 
to Sumer civilisation in 
Mesopotamia. Names of Sumerian 
kings and the stories of battles 
fought by them have been preserved 
in various inscriptions. The earliest 
inscription shown above, dates back 
to 4500 B.C.E.  It records a battle 
fought between two kingdoms. It is 
now displayed at the Louvre 
museum in France. 
The earliest inscription in the
Louvre museum

(3) Answers to these questions are 
supported by reliable evidence. 
(4) History presents a graph of 
mankind’s journey with the help of past 
human deeds. 
It is said that the modern 
historiography with above characteristics 
has its roots in the ancient Greek historical 
writings. ‘History’ is originally a Greek 
term. Herodotus, the Greek historian of 
the fifth century B.C.E. used it first for 
his book entitled, ‘The Histories’. 
1.3 Development of  Scientific 
Perspective in Europe and 
Historiography 
Till the eighteenth century C.E. 
Europe had achieved a remarkable 
progress in the fields of Philosophy and 
Science. Scholars by then had come to 
believe in the possibility of studying the 
social and historical truths by applying 
scientific methods. Now the philosophical 
discussions focused more and more on the 
objectivity in history and historiography. 
 Prior to the eighteenth century all 
European universities were interested only 
in the philosophical discourses revolving 
around Divine phenomena. However, 
gradually this scenario began to change. 
In 1737 C.E. the Gottingen University 
was founded in Germany. This university 
for the first time had an independent 
department of history. Later, other German 
universities also became centres of 
historical studies. 
1.4 Notable Scholars
The contributions of many scholars 
are important in the development of 
historiography. Let us have a look at the 
contributions of the few notable scholars. 
René Descartes 
(1596-1650) : René 
Descartes was the 
foremost among 
scholars who insisted 
on verifying the 
reliability of 
historical documents 
by critically 
examining them. 
Among the rules 
given by him in his book, ‘Discourse on 
the method’, the following is supposed to 
have a great impact on the scientific 
method of research : Never to accept 
anything for true till all grounds of doubt 
are excluded. 
Voltaire (1694-1778) : Voltaire’s 
original name was François-Marie Arouet. 
He was French. He 
opined that along 
with objective truth 
and chronology of 
historical events 
considering social 
traditions, trade, 
economy, agriculture, 
etc. was also equally 
important in historiography. It gave rise 
to the thought that understanding all 
aspects of human life is important for 
history writing. Thus, it is said that 
Voltaire was the founder of modern 
historiography. 
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel 
(1770-1831) : Hegel was a German 
philosopher. He insisted that the historical 
reality should be presented in a logical 
manner.  To him the timeline of historical 
events was indicative of progress. He also 
thought that the presentation of history is 
bound to change over time as new 
René Descartes
Voltaire

evidence would 
come forth.  With 
Hegel’s philosophy 
many scholars were 
convinced that 
historical methods 
were not of lesser 
quality though they 
differed from 
scientific methods. 
The collection of his 
lectures and articles 
is published in a book, entitled 
‘Encyclopaedia of Philosophical Sciences’. 
His book, ‘Reason in History’, is well 
known.  
Georg Wilhelm 
Friedrich Hegel 
It is good to know this :
According to Hegel, grasping 
the meaning of any event happens 
in terms of two direct opposites. 
Human mind cannot understand the 
true nature of that event, without 
understanding the opposites, for 
example, True-False, Good-Bad, 
etc. In order to understand the true 
nature of a thing one needs to know 
both true and false, similarly good 
and bad. This method of analysis 
which is based on opposites is 
known as ‘Dialectics’. In this 
method a theory is proposed at the 
beginning, which is called, ‘Thesis’. 
Then another theory is proposed, 
which is contrary to the thesis. It is 
called, ‘Antithesis’. After a thorough 
logical discussion of the both a new 
thesis is proposed which includes 
the gist of both, the thesis and the 
antithesis. This process of arriving 
at the new thesis is called, 
‘Synthesis’.
Leopold von Ranké (1795-1886) : 
Historiography of the nineteenth century 
was greatly influenced by the thoughts of 
Leopold Von Ranke of Berlin University. 
He spoke about the critical method of 
historical research. He put emphasis on 
the utmost importance of information 
gathered through 
original documents. 
He also stated that 
all types of 
documents associated 
with a historical 
event need to be 
examined with 
greatest care. He 
believed that with 
this method it was 
possible to reach the historical truth. He 
criticised imaginative narration of history. 
Collection of his articles is published in 
two books, entitled ‘The Theory and 
Practice of History’ and ‘The Secret of 
World History’. 
 Karl Marx  (1818-1883) : In the 
latter half of the nineteenth century a new 
school of thought arose keeping in view 
the new thesis formulated by Karl Marx. 
According to Karl Marx, history was not 
about abstract ideas; it was about living 
people. Human relationships are shaped 
by the fundamental needs of people and 
the ownership as well as nature of 
prevalent means 
of production to 
meet those needs. 
The accessibility 
of these means to 
different strata of 
the society may 
not be equal. This 
inequality causes Karl Marx
Leopold von Ranké
5
a division of the society into classes, 
leading to class struggle. According to 
Marx, human history is the history of 
class struggle, as the class that owns the 
means of production economically exploits 
the rest of the classes. ‘Das Kapital’, a 
treatise written by him is the most referred 
book all over the world. 
Annales School : At the onset of the 
twentieth century a new school of 
historiography arose in France, which is 
known as ‘Annales School’.  Annales 
school gave a new direction to history 
writing. It was recognised now that history 
is not only about the political events, 
kings, great leaders and accordingly 
politics, diplomacy and wars but also 
about the climate, local people, agriculture, 
trade, technology, means of 
communication, social divisions and their 
collective psychology, etc. in the historical 
times. The Annales School was started by 
French historians. 
Feminist Historiography 
Feminist historiography means the 
restructuring of the history from the 
perspective of women. The writings of 
Simone de Beauvoir, helped in establishing 
the fundamentals of feminism. She was 
French. The feminist historiography 
emphasised not only on the inclusion of 
women in history but also on the rethinking 
of the male dominated perspective of 
history. It drove historical research to 
focus in depth on various aspects of 
women’s life such as their employment, 
their role in trade union, institutions 
working for their cause, their family life, 
etc.  In the historical writings after 1990 
women were portrayed as an independent 
social class. 
Michel Foucault (1926-1984) : The 
French historian of the twentieth century, 
Michel Foucault brought forth a new 
concept in historiography. He, in his book, 
‘Archaeology of Knowledge’, argued that 
the prevailing practice of arranging 
historical events in a chronological order 
is not right. He 
drew attention to 
the fact that 
archaeology does 
not strive to 
reach the ultimate 
historical truth 
but attempts to 
explain various 
transitions in the 
past. Foucault felt 
that explaining the transitions in history 
is more important. He called his method, 
‘the archaeology of knowledge’. 
Foucault subjected the so far 
unacknowledged areas by historians such 
as psychological disorders, science of 
medicine, prison administration, etc. to 
historical analysis.  
 Thus, the scope of historiography 
kept continuously expanding. Writing of 
histories of various subjects like literature, 
architecture, sculpture, drawing and 
painting, music, dance, drama, films and 
television, etc. came into practice.

2. Historiography : Indian Tradition
2.1 Tradition of Indian Historiography
2.2 Indian Historiography : Various 
Ideological Frameworks
2.1 Tradition of Indian Historiography
We learnt about the western tradition 
of historiography in the last lesson. In 
this lesson we will know about the 
tradition of Indian historiography.
Historiography in the Ancient 
Period : In the ancient period in India 
memories of the great deeds of ancestors 
and mythological lore, also memories of 
social transitions were preserved with the 
help of oral recitals.
The inscriptions on the Harappan 
seals and other artefacts confirm that 
Indians had mastered the art of writing 
as early as the third millennium B.C.E. 
or perhaps before that. However, the 
Harappan script is not yet successfully 
deciphered.
The earliest known written documents 
of historical nature found in India are in 
the form of inscriptions. They are dated 
to the 3rd century B.C.E., that is emperor 
Ashok Maurya’s times. His edicts are 
inscribed on natural rocks and stone 
pillars.
From the 1st century C.E. inscriptions 
begin to occur on coins, metal images 
and sculptures, and also on copper plates. 
They provide important historical 
information. We get to know about the 
dates of various kings, dynastic 
genealogies, territorial extent and 
administration of various empires and 
kingdoms and also important political 
events, social organisation, climate, 
famines, etc. of the respective times.
The ancient Indian literature including 
the epics Ramayana and Mahabharat, 
Puranas, Jain and Buddhist texts, historical 
accounts by Indian authors and also 
travelogues by foreign travellers are 
Sohagaura Copper-plate :  The 
copper-plate was found at Sohagaura 
(District Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh). It 
is supposed to be from the Mauryan 
period. The inscription on it is in 
Brahmi script. The symbols known as 
‘Tree-in-railing’ and ‘Mountain’ at 
the beginning of the inscription also 
occur on punch marked coins. Another 
symbol which looks like a structure 
erected on four pilars is supposed to 
be indicative of a granary. The 
inscription records a royal order that 
the grains stored in the granary should 
be distributed carefully. It is supposed 
to be suggestive of precautions taken 
in the times of a famine.

important sources of history.  
Writing of biographies of kings and 
dynastic histories mark an important step 
in the Indian historiography. 
‘Harshacharit’, written in the 7th century 
C.E. by Banabhatta is King Harsha’s 
biography. It portrays a realistic picture 
of the social, economic, political,religious 
and cultural life during the king’s times. 
Historiography in the Medieval 
Period : The style of writing 
‘Rajtarangini’, the history of Kashmir by 
Kalhana in the 12th century C.E. is quite 
close to the concept of modern 
historiography. Kalhana himself says that 
he wrote this text after critically examining 
various sources like inscriptions, coins, 
remains of ancient monuments, dynastic 
records and local traditons.
In the medieval India the historians 
in the courts of Muslim rulers were 
influenced by Arabic and Persian 
historiography. Among them Ziauddin 
Barani holds an important place. In 
‘Tarikh-i-Phiruz Shahi’, a book written by 
him, he has stated the purpose of 
historiography. According to him the 
historian’s duty is not limited only to the 
recording of the ruler’s valour and policies 
of welfare but he should also write about 
the ruler’s failings and incorrect policies. 
Barani further says that a historian should 
also take into consideration the impact of 
the teachings of the wise, the learned, 
and the saints on the cultural life of 
people. Thus, Barani expanded the scope 
of historiography. 
For the historians in the Mughal 
courts praising the emperors and exhibition 
of loyalty became more important. The 
custom of adding suitable poetic quotes 
and beautiful pictures was also introduced. 
Babur, the founder of the Mughal empire 
wrote an autobiography, entitled,

descriptions of the battles fought by him. 
Babur also recorded his minute 
observations of various regions and cities 
travelled by him including the local 
economy, customs and the flora.
 Abul Fazl’s ‘Akbarnama’ is very 
important from the viewpoint of critical 
historiography. His method of collecting

the following period many books about 
India were written by foreign scholars. 
Among them, to name a few, are : 
Hasan Nizami’s ‘Tajul-Ma’asir’; 
Minhaj-i-Siraj’s ‘Tabaqat-i-Nasiri’; 
various works by Amir Khusrau; 
‘Tuzuk-i-Timuri’, the autobiography of 
Timur (-i) Lang, who was also known 
as Amir Timur who invaded India; 
‘Tarikh-i- Mubarakshahi’ by Yahya 
Bin Ahmad Sirhindi. Their accounts 
provide us with historic information of 
Sultanate period. 
Accounts of foreign travellers in 
India are also important. Among them 
are Ibn Battuta, Abdul Razzaq, Marco 
Polo, Nicolo Conti, Barbosa and 
Domingos Paes. Their accounts provide 
us with historic information of medieval 
India. Ishwardas Nagar, Bhimsen 
Saxena, Khafi Khan and Niccolao 
Manucci were among the historians of 
Aurangzeb’s times whose accounts are 
important sources of Mughal history.

scrutiny is looked upon as devoid of bias 
and hence realistic. 
‘Bakhar’ is an important type of 
historical documents of medieval times. It 
contains eulogies of the heroes and stories 
of historic events, battles, lives of great 
men.
Marathi bakhars are of various types. 
‘Sabhasad Bakhar’ was written by 
Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad during the 
reign of Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj. It 
is an important bakhar for getting 
information about the rule of Chhatrapati 
Shivaji Maharaj. 
‘Bhausahebanchi Bakhar’ describes 
the Battle of Panipat. Another bakhar, 
entitled ‘Panipatachi Bakhar’, is also 
about the same event. ‘Holkaranchi 
Kaiphiyat’ provides information about the 
Holkars and their contributions to the 
Maratha rule.
Bakhars can be divided into various 
types such as biographies of kings, 
dynastic history,  descriptions of events, 
history of a sect, autobiographies, 
regarding grievance, based on mythologies 
and state administration by  a king.
Historiography in the Modern 
Period : In the 20th century the Indian 
archaeological exploration and research 
started under the British rule.  A number 
of ancient sites were excavated under the 
supervision of Sir Alexander Cunningham, 
the first Director General of the 
Archaeological Survey of India. He chose 
mainly the sites mentioned in the Buddhist 
texts for this purpose. Harappan 
Civilisation was discovered during the 
tenure of Sir John Marshall. Because of 
this discovery the antiquity of Indian 
history could be traced to 3rd millennium 
B.C.E. or even earlier.
Many British officials in India wrote 
about Indian history. Their writings 
display strong influence of the colonial 
policies of the British.
Three Volumes of ‘The History of 
British India’, written by James Mill were 
published in 1817. This was the first book 
on Indian history 
written by a British 
historian. It clearly 
reflects an absence 
of objective 
perspective and 
prejudice about 
various aspects of 
the Indian culture. 
‘The History of 
India’, written by Mountstuart Elphinstone, 
Governor of Bombay (now Mumbai) was 
published in 1841.
The period of Maratha Empire is 
very important in the Indian history. 
Grant Duff’s name stands out among the 
British officers who wrote about Maratha 
history. He wrote the book entitled, ‘A 
History of Mahrattas’. This book is 
published in three volumes. Grant Duff’s 
writing also shows the British inclination 
of condemning Indian culture and history. 
Similar tendency is witnessed in Colonel 
Todd’s writings about Rajasthan’s history. 
The two volumes written by William 
James Mill
John MarshallAlexander Cunningham

Wilson Hunter on Indian history show a 
somewhat impartial treatment of the 
subject.
Nilkanth Janardan Kirtane and 
Vishwanath Kashinath Rajwade were two 
Indian historians who took upon the task 
of exposing the limitations of Grant 
Duff’s writings.
2.2 Indian Historiography : Various 
Ideological Frameworks
Colonial Historiography :  The early 
scholars who studied and wrote Indian 
history were mainly British officers and 
Christian missionaries. Their prejudice is 
clearly reflected in the way some of them 
have ridiculed Indian culture. Their 
writings were used to justify the colonial 
British rule. The five volumes of 
‘Cambridge History of India’, published 
during  1922-1937 C.E. are distinct 
examples of colonial historiography. 
Orientalist Historiography : Many 
European scholars felt curious about 
civilisations and countries of the East. 
Some of those scholars felt admiration 
and respect for them.  These scholars 
were known as ‘Orientalists’.
The orientalists studied the similarities 
between Sanskrit and some of the 
European languages. They focused more 
on Vedic tradition and Sanskrit literature. 
Their studies resulted into formulating the 
notion of an ancient language that could 
be the mother of all Indo-European 
languages.
In 1784, Sir William Jones founded 
Asiatic society in Kolkata. It opened the 
doors for research in ancient Indian 
literature and history.
Among the Orientalist scholars, 
Friedrich Max Muller deserves a special 
mention.  In his 
opinion Sanskrit was 
the most ancient 
language of the Indo-
European languages. 
He was deeply 
interested in Sanskrit 
literature. He first 
translated the Sanskrit 
text of ‘Hitopadesh’. He was the editor 
of 50 volumes of ‘The Sacred Books of 
the East’. He also compiled ‘Rigveda’, 
which has been 
published in six 
volumes. He 
translated Rigveda 
in German.
Lately, Edward 
Said, a scholar 
who has re-
evaluated the 
orientalist writings, 
has thrown light on imperialistic interests 
of orientalist scholors. 
Nationalistic Historiography :  The 
writings of Indian historians who were 
trained in the British educational system 
show an inclination to restore the pride 
in the ancient glory of India and the self-
esteem of the Indian readers. Their 
writings are known as ‘Nationalistic 
Historiography’. Nationalistic writings in 
Maharashtra were inspired by 
Vishnushastri Chiplunkar. He criticised 
the prejudiced history of ancient India 
written by British officers. The nationalistic 
historians tried to seek the golden era of 
Indian history. They are at times blamed 
for ignoring the critical analysis of the 
historical truth.  Mahadev Govind Ranade,

‘Human history is defined by 
Time and Space. Describing any 
event necessitates that the final 
portrayal should be spread on the 
complete canvass of the given time 
and place.
Only if a balanced combination 
of the three factors, Time, Space 
and Personalities is present, then 
only an event does qualify to  be 
called so.’
 - V. K. Rajwade 
Rajwade is well-known for his 
writings in Marathi on varied subjects 
like history, linguistics, 
etymology, grammar, 
etc. He was of the 
firm opinion that we 
should write our own 
history.  He compiled 
and edited 22 volumes 
of ‘Marathyanchya 
Itihasachi Sadhane’. 
He wrote very 
scholarly prefaces to each of the 22 
volumes. He stated, ‘History is the 
all-inclusive image of the past societies. 
It does not include only the stories of 
political images, conspiracies and wars 
for seizing power.’ He insisted that history 
should be written only using the authentic 
documentary source. 
The nationalistic historiography helped 
in the triggering of the independence 
movement of the 
Indian people against 
the British.  In this 
aspect the book, ‘The 
Indian War of 
Independence, 1857’, 
written by Vinayak 
Damodar Savarkar is 
of great importance.
The nationalistic historiography 
provided a momentum to the writing of 
regional histories too. As a result the 
attention of historians was drawn to the 
geographic conditions and history of south 
Indian regions.
Historiography in the Post-
Independence Era : Now along with 
writing the dynastic histories, the cultural, 
social, economic histories were also being 
written.  Scholars of the post-independence

era began to feel the need of writing 
histories of various communities, sciences, 
economic systems, political ideologies, 
cultural aspects, etc. The historiography 
of this era has been influenced mainly by 
three ideological schools: (1) Marxist 
History (2) Subaltern History (3) Feminist 
History.
Marxist Histroy :  The concern for 
the means of production, modes of 
production and the industrial relations 
were at the centre in the writings of 
Marxist historians. Accordingly, to analyse 
the impact of every social event of 
significance has 
remained the basic 
theme of Marxist 
historiography.
Marxist historians 
in India studied the 
transitions within the 
caste system. Among 
the notable Indian 
historians who adopted Marxist ideological 
framework, scholars like Damodar 
Dharmanand Kosambi, Comrade Shripad 
Amrut Dange, Ram Sharan Sharma, 
Comrade Sharad Patil have contributed 
notably. Comrade Dange was one of the 
founder members of the Indian Communist 
Party. ‘Primitive Communism to Slavery’, 
the book written by him represents Marxist 
historiography.
Subaltern History : The seeds of 
subaltern history are found in the Marxist 
historiography. The role of the Italian 
historian Antonio Gramsci is very 
important in developing the idea that 
history should be written starting from the 
bottommost ranks of people in the society. 
In fact, subaltern means the ‘bottommost 
ranks’.
Folklore has been considered as a 
very important source of writing subaltern 
histories. Ranjit Guha, an Indian historian 
played a major role in establishing 
subaltern history as an important academic 
school of historiography. However, we 
may point out that much before the onset 
of subaltern ideology similar thoughts 
were expressed by Mahatma Jyotirao 
Phule and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Mahatma Phule unfolded the history 
of the ‘shudratishudra’ commuunities in 
his book, ‘Gulamgiri’. 
He drew attention to 
the exploitation of 
women, shudras and 
atishudras done under 
the name of religion.
The terms 
‘shudra’ and 
‘atishudra’ indicates 
the bottommost ranks in the caste system.
The role of the people belonging to 
Dalit castes is very significant in the 
shaping of various cultural and political 
aspects of India. However, their role was 
not duly acknowledged in the colonial and 
nationalistic historiography. Dr Babasaheb 
Ambedkar focusing on 
this fact, consistently 
wrote about it. Two of 
his books, ‘Who Were 
the Shudras’ and ‘The 
Untouchables’ may be 
cited as examples of 
history of subaltern 
type.
Feminist History : Over a significant 
period of time, mainly male scholars were 
involved in the writing of Indian history. 
As a result, the role and achievements of 
women in history remained neglected. To 
Mahatma Jotirao Phule
Dr Ambedkar

highlight this fact was a major task faced 
by the feminist historians. Also, it was 
important to study and compile the 
historical writings of women. It was also 
necessary to rethink of women’s position 
in history.
Among women authors writing about 
women in the 19th 
century C.E., Tarabai 
Shinde was the 
foremost one.  She 
wrote attacking the 
male dominated 
social system and 
the caste system. 
Her book, ‘Stripurush 
Tulana’, published 
in 1882, is acknowledged as the first 
feminist book in India. In 1888, the book 
written by Pandita Ramabai was published, 
entitled, ‘The High Caste Hindu Woman’.
The feminist literature of the post-
independence era concentrated on the 
issues like employment of women, 
treatement meted out to them at their 
work place, their right to political equality, 
etc. Among the recently published feminist 
literature Meera Kosambi’s book, 
‘Crossing Thresholds : Feminist Essays in 
Social History’ is of importance. It 
contains essays on the life stories of 
women like Pandita Ramabai and Dr. 
Rukhamabai, the first practicing lady 
doctor of India. A lot of literature is 
available unfolding the viewpoint of Dalit 
women in Maharashtra. Dr. Sharmila 
Rege’s work is noteworthy in this context. 
Her book, ‘Writing Caste, Writing Gender  : 
Reading Dalit Women’s Testimonies’ 
includes her essays on the autobiographies 
of Dalit women.
Tarabai Shinde
There have been a number of Indian 
historians who wrote without embracing 
a particular ideology. Among them 
historians like Sir Jadunath Sarkar, 
Surendra Nath Sen, Riyasatkar G.S. 
Sardesai, and Tryambak Shankar 
Shejawalkar are noteworthy. 
In the recent times historians like 
Yashawant Dinkar Phadke, Ramchandra 
Guha, etc. have contributed extensively to 
the historiography of modern India.
Thus, it is evident that the Indian 
historiography has been influenced greatly 
by the social and political movements. It 
seems that some part of the Indian 
historiography was also developed outside 
the influence of these movements.
Do you know ?
Publication of  ‘Marathi 
Riyasat’ by Govind Sakharam 
Sardesai was a momentous 
achievement in the field of Indian 
Historiography. His work became 
so famous that people began to 
address him as ‘Riyasatkar’. He 
published several volumes of 
Maratha history.

3. Applied History
3.1 What is Applied History ?
‘Applied History’ is also known as 
‘Public History’. ‘Applied History’ is a 
field of study concerned with the 
application of history for the benefit of 
people in the contemporary and future 
It is interesting to know : 
Public History : People have lot of 
misgivings about the practicality of the 
knowledge of history. For example, history 
is usually thought as a field of interest 
only for historians and students wishing 
to pursue higher studies in the subject and 
not pertaining to practical life, history as 
a field of knowledge does not have any 
applicability to economically productive 
fields, etc.
‘Public History’ helps to overcome 
such misgivings and makes history 
meaningful in everyday life connecting 
people to history.
There are many universities abroad, 
where various courses in 'Public History' 
are offered. Srushti Institute of Art Design 
and Technology is an institute at Bengaluru, 
Karnataka. This institute has an 
independent department, named, ‘Centre 
for Public History’. This department has 
taken up various projects and research in 
the field of public history.
times. Knowledge of history is useful as 
it can provide guidance in finding solutions 
to contemporary social issues and 
incorporate them in the social planning. 
Knowledge of history is essential for this 
purpose.
The projects and programmes related 
to applied history can create opportunities 
for people to participate along with the 
technical experts. Their participation in the 
capacity of tourists visiting museums and 
ancient sites is also important. Tourism 
creats interest in history among people. 
They can volunteer to participate in the 
conservation and preservation projects of 
their own city or town or village.
3.2 Applied History and Research in 
Various Fields
History is about the past events. The 
way our present life style is shaped, is 
dependent on the historical chain of 
events. Historical events relate to various 
fields like politics, social and religious 
structure of a community, philosophy, 
technology and science, etc. Each of these 
fields have their own history of building 
knowledge. The direction of future 
development in every field is dependent 
on the state of available knowledge. 
Hence, the method of history can prove 
to be of value in the research of various 
fields. For example,
(1) Philosophy : The history of 
philosophy helps in understanding the 
origin of various ideologies, the intellectual 
traditions giving rise to those ideologies 
and their historical development. 
Philosophy needs language as a medium

of expression. In order to understand the 
philosophical expression, knowledge of 
the history of language proves useful.
(2) Science : The history of science 
helps in understanding the chronological 
order of scientific discoveries, inventions 
and theories. It can also help to understand 
the cause-effect chain that led to those 
discoveries and inventions.  It is said that 
‘need’ is the mother of inventions. 
Scientific discoveries/inventions are often 
the effects of human efforts to fulfil a 
need and also curiosity. These efforts are 
based on already available scientific 
knowledge. Knowledge of history of 
science helps in understanding the factors 
that facilitated a scientific discovery/
invention and also its chronology.
(3) Technology : The history of 
technology helps in understanding the 
changes and their causes in the field of 
agricultural production,  commodity 
production, architecture, engineering, etc. 
Scientific discoveries/inventions and 
technological advancement are mutually 
dependent on each other. Knowledge of 
science and technology was very important 
at every step from the making of stone 
tools to agricultural production in the 
evolution of mankind. Later the 
advancement of science promoted the 
mechanisation of production.  It is 
necessary to know the history of technology 
in order to understand the development of 
mechanisation and the mutual dependence 
between science and technology.
(4) Industry and Commerce : The 
field of mutual social transactions expands 
with the growth of industry and trade. It 
also promotes continuous development of 
the network of cultural interactions. It is 
an integral part of the industrial and 
commercial management. It is essential to 
understand the history of these processes. 
The nature of the market and commerce 
has continued to change. Accordingly, the 
nature of human relationships and the 
social organisation also has continued to 
change. To understand this development 
it is necessary to study the history of 
culture, social organisation and economic 
institutions.
(5) Management Studies : In order 
to understand various factors involved in 
the chain of production such as means of 
production, human resources and processes 
of production, as well as the chain of 
market and sales management, etc. it is 
essential to have a knowledge of similar 
functional systems of the past.  It is 
essential to understand the psychological 
character of people working at various 
levels in the chain of production and 
marketing for healthy management. In 
order to achieve it, understanding of the 
social and economic institutions that 
support the industrial and commercial 
processes is important. Knowledge of 
history in this regard makes the 
management at various levels easier.
(6) Arts : It is important to understand 
the development of various art forms with 
the help of their style of expression and 
their foundation in the form of intellectual-
emotional-cultural traditions. The key to 
the expressions in any art form, emotional 
temperament of the artist and the 
developmental history of the respective 
art form can be understood with the help 
of cultural history.
(7) Humanities : Humanities include 
disciplines like history, archaeology, 
sociology, anthropology, political science, 
economics, etc. To understand the history 
of the origin and development of these 
disciplines is an essential part of their 
17
3.4 Management of Cultural and 
Natural Heritage 
(a) Cultural Heritage :  It is in the 
form of human creation. It is of two types 
- tangible and intangible.
1. Tangible Cultural Heritage : This 
type of cultural heritage includes ancient 
sites, buildings, artefacts, manuscripts, 
sculptures, paintings, etc.
2. Intangible Cultural Heritage : 
This type of cultural heritage includes the 
following things -
* Oral traditions and their language
* Traditional knowledge
* Social customs and rituals of 
celebrating festivals
* Styles of performing arts
* Certain traditional skills
* Communities, groups who represent 
such traditions, Customs and skills
(b) Natural Heritage :  the concept 
of natural heritage gives importance to 
the thought of biodiversity. It includes the 
following things -
(1) Fauna (2) Flora (3) Ecology and 
geomorphic characteristics which is crucial 
for sustaining the flora and fauna of a 
particular region.
It is essential for the benefit of future 
generations to preserve our heritage. 
UNESCO, the global organisation has 
announced some directives with the 
objective of promoting the cultural and 
natural heritage. On the basis of those 
directives list of sites and traditions are 
declared as ‘World Heritage’.
The list of UNESCO’s World Natural 
Heritage now includes Western Ghats. 
The Kaas plateau in the District Satara, 
is also a part of the Western Ghats. 
learning.  All disciplines are supposed to 
have their origin in philosophy.  Ancient 
people all over the world tried to speculate 
in order to understand the relationship 
between the universe and human existence. 
It gave rise to various mythological stories 
about the origin of this world, the 
universal order, human life, gods and 
goddesses, rituals and their philosophical 
explanation. Roots of philosophical 
ponderings are to be found in these 
mythological stories. Various disciplines 
under humanities have theoretical 
foundations based on philosophical 
theories. Only historical knowledge can 
help us in understanding these 
developmental stages.
3.3 Applied History and Our Present 
People often ask about the practical 
value of history. The answer to the 
question about the nature of applied 
history answers this question as well. 
The visible and invisible relics of the past 
exist in the present. We nurture some 
kind of curiosity, attraction toward them. 
We wish to know more about their history 
because they represent the creative 
thoughts and traditions of our ancestors. 
It is our heritage. It helps in building our 
identity. The history of our heritage links 
us with our origin. Hence it becomes 
necessary to preserve and conserve it for 
future, for our benefit as well as for the 
benefit of future generations. Applied 
history is concerned with the preservation 
and conservation of our heritage and 
make it accessible to people. Heritage 
management creates opportunities of 
employment. In brief, applied history can 
be described as understanding of our 
present with the help of history and 
finding right direction for the benefit of 
our future.

‘Cultural and Natural Heritage 
Management’ is one of the main aspects 
of applied  history. The work of 
conservation and preservation of the 
Cultural Heritage falls under the 
jurisdiction of the Archaeological Survey 
of India and India’s State Departments of 
Archaeology. Beside, INTACH (Indian 
National Trust for Art and Cultural 
Heritage) is actively working in this field. 
The work of conservation and preservation 
of cultural and natural heritage requires 
participation of experts from various 
fields. They need to be duly aware of the 
cultural, social and political histories of 
the heritage site. Principles of applied 
history are useful in creating the awareness 
among them. Thus,
(1) The operations necessary for the 
conservation, preservation and 
development of the heritage site can be 
handled without causing any change in 
its original state.
(2) The local social structure and 
psychology of the local people, challenges 
faced by them in the present situations 
and their expectations can be surveyed in 
detail.
(3) Due precautions can be taken to 
avoid hurting sentiments of the local 
The earliest 
museum (6th century 
B.C.E.) in the world 
was discovered 
during the 
excavations at the 
city of ‘Ur’ in 
Mesopotamia. The 
excavations were 
conducted by Sir 
Leonard Woolley 
(1922-1934). This museum was built by 
the princess of Mesopotamia. Her name 
was Ennigaldi. She herself was the 
curator of the museum.
A noteworthy feature of the that 
museum is the clay tablets inscribed 
with the descriptions of exhibited 
artefacts.

history can create various opportunities 
for these professionals. 
In this lesson we learnt about the role 
of applied history in public training 
programmes for understanding the 
importance of history, for creating social 
awareness regarding the conservation, 
preservation of our cultural and natural 
heritage, using knowledge of history for 
this purpose, to enhance the professional 
skills of people and to develop industrial, 
commercial field, to carry out preparatory 
work and plan for effective implementation 
The ‘Indian Museum’ at 
Kolkata was founded by the Asiatic 
Society in 1814 C.E.  Nathaniel 
Wallich, a Danish botanist was the 
founder and the first curator of the 
museum. The photograph of the 
museum seen here is dated to 1905. 
The museum has three main 
departments, Arts, Archaeology and 
Anthropology. Other affiliated 
departments are : conservation, 
publication, photography, 
exhibition-presentation, model-
making, training, library, security.

Every field mentioned here requires 
expert personnel with specialised skills. 
For example, architects, engineers, 
historians, archaeologists, museum 
curators, sociologists, archive management 
professionals, legal experts, skilled 
photographers, etc. Of course, this is just 
a representative list. The help of experts 
from many more fields is required. These 
experts need to have adequate knowledge 
of the ancient sites, the historical 
background of the structural remains and

It is interesting to know : 
Archives preserve and store old 
documents, official records, old 
films, etc.
The National Archives of India 
is in Delhi. Every state in India 
maintains its archives independently. 
Archives with a distinct purpose : 
The main office of the National 
Film Archives of India is located in 
Pune, Maharashtra. It was established 
in 1964 as the Media Unit of the 
Ministry of Information and 
Broadcasting of the Indian Government. 
It served three objectives. 
 To search and obtain rare Indian 
films and to preserve the heritage 
for the benefit of future generations.
 To categorise the important aspects 
of films, to create documentation 
and catalogues and carry out 
research in the field.
 To establish a centre for 
dissemination of ‘films culture’.

4.3 Indian traditions of Performing Arts
4.4 Art, Applied Art and Professional 
Opportunities
4.1 What is Art ?
It is a natural human instinct to want 
to share his experience, wisdom, and also 
emotions.  When that instinct results in a 
beautiful creation, it is acknowledged as 
‘Art’. The artist’s power of imagination, 
sensibility, state of emotion and his skills 
are the crucial factors at the root of 
artistic creation.
Visual Arts and Performing Arts  : 
Artistic creations are of two types, ‘Visual 
Arts’ and ‘Performing Arts’. The Sanskrit 
term for the first type is Drik Kala and for 
the second type, Lalit or Aangik Kala. Many 
examples of Prehistoric rock art have been 
discovered at many sites in the world. It 
proves that the origin of visual arts is as 
old as the stone-age man.
Folk Arts and Classical Arts :  There 
are two distinct traditions of art, ‘Folk Art’ 
and ‘Classical Art’. Folk art is a tradition 
that has continued from the prehistoric 
times. The expression of folk art is a 
natural part of people’s way of living. 
Hence its expression is spontaneous. Folk 
art is created by collective participation of 
the members of a social group. Classical 
art, on the other hand, is expressed within 
an established frame of consistent rules. It 
needs a prolonged training to master any 
form of classical art.
Style in Art  : Artists tend to have 
their own method of working. It is known 
as the style of the artist. When a style is 
adopted by many artists over a prolonged 
period of time, it may become a tradition. 
Such tradition gets established as an ‘art 
style’. Various art styles develop in every 
culture, which are characteristic of a 
certain period and region. Such styles are 
helpful in studying art history.
4.2 Indian Traditions of Visual Arts 
(Drik Kala)
The art of painting and sculpting are 
visual arts.
Maratha Style of Painting : Maratha paintings is 
an example of art style. The style known as Maratha 
paintings began to develop in the latter half of the 
17th century C.E. This style consists of coloured 
paintings and they occur as murals and also miniatures 
used in manuscripts. Murals of Maratha style can be 
seen in the old wadas at places like Wai, Menavali 
and Satara in Maharashtra. The Maratha style was 
influenced by the Rajput and European styles of 
painting.
Painting styles help us in understanding various 
things about the times in which it was developed such 
as the life style, attires, customs, etc. 
23
Art of Painting : Paintings are two 
dimensional, for 
example, sketches or 
paintings of nature, 
objects and individuals. 
They are done on 
various surfaces, such 
as rocks, walls, papers, 
canvas of different 
types and earthen pots. 
The mural of 
Bodhisattva at Ajanta 
caves is one of the 
finest examples of the art of painting.
Folk styles of Paintings : Rock 
paintings dating to stone ages have been 
discovered in many countries. 
In India, there are rock painting sites 
in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar 
Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, 
Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The rock 
paintings in the caves at Bhimbetka are 
famous. Bhimbetka is a World Heritage 
site.
Rock paintings usually depict human, 
animal and geometric figures. However, the 
style of rock paintings seems to be changing 
according to the cultural changes from 
stone ages to the beginning of agriculture. 
The change is visible in the depiction of 
flora and fauna or it may be evident in the 
style of portraying various figures and also 
in the colours that were used. Black, red 
and white colours were used in the rock 
paintings, which were made from natural 
substances. With the help of rock paintings 
we can understand the knowledge of ancient 
people about their natural surroundings and 
also the way they exploited available 
natural resources.
The tradition of folk style of paintings 
closely resembles the style of rock paintings. 
Customs such as decorating the house 
walls and courtyards (Rangawali) by 
drawing various figures and symbols or 
using panels of paintings to narrate stories 
helped to develop regional styles of folk 
paintings.
The tradition of Chitrakathi is 
mentioned in ‘Manasollas’, a book 
written by the Chalukya king Someshvara 
in the 12th century C.E.  It confirms the 
antiquity of this tradition. The tradition 
of narrating stories from Ramayana or 
Mahabharata with the help of wooden

The traditions of Warli painting and 
Pingul or chitrakathi in Maharashtra are 
among the finest examples of folk style 
of paintings. Jivya Somya Mashe, the 
artist in Thane district has played a great 
role in making the Warli style of paintings 
very popular. He has been honoured with 
a number of national and international 
awards for his paintings.  In the year 
2011, he was awarded ‘Padmashree’.
It is interesting to know : 
24
Classical Styles of Painting : The 
ancient Indian texts have explained various 
aspects of arts in great details. There are 
altogether 64 arts mentioned in these texts. 
The art of painting is mentioned as alekhyam 
or alekhya vidya in these. 
It is said to have six main aspects 
(Shadange). The ancient Indian scholars 
studied these six aspects very minutely. 
They include : Roopbheda  (Different 
shapes and forms), Pramana (Proportionate 
depiction of various features of an image), 
Bhava (Expressions), Lavanyayojana 
(Aesthetics), Sadrushyata (A resemblance 
to reality), Varnikabhang (Colour 
composition).
Agama texts of various religious sects, 
Puranas, and Vastushastra texts explain 
the arts of painting and sculpting in the 
context of temple architecture.
Miniature Paintings in Manuscripts : 
The miniature paintings in the early 
manuscripts show an influence of Persian 
style. The Deccan miniature style was 
developed under the patronage of the 
Deccan Sultanates. During the reign of 
Akbar, the Mughal emperor, the Mughal 
miniature style 
showing a blend of 
Indian and Persian 
styles was 
developed.
Western Style 
of Painting : In the 
British period Indian 
artists came under 
the influence of 
European style of 
painting.  An art 
school was established under the leadership 
of James Wales, a Scottish artist, in the 
times of Savai 
Madhavrao Peshwe 
in Shaniwar Wada 
in Pune. He had 
done a portrait of 
Savai Madhavrao 
and Nana 
Phadnavis. 
Gagaram Tambat, a 
marathi artist who 
worked with Wales 
deserves a special 
mention here. He 
puppets and paintings is known as, 
Chitrakathi or Pinguli tradition. The 
people who still practice the art of 
Pingul live in a village called Pinguli. 
They belong to Thakar tribal 
community. It is located in the Konkan 
region, near Kudal. The Chitrakathi 
pictures are drawn on a paper and 
painted in colours made from natural 
substances. It takes 30-50 pictures to 
complete the narration of a single story. 
These pictures are preserved very 
carefully and handed down from one 
generation to another. The artists and 
the government are trying to preserve 
the tradition, which is on the verge of 
extinction.
Mughal Miniature
Savai Madhavrao and 
Nana Phadnavis
Gangaram Tambat with his Guru
had made drawings of the rock-cut caves 
at Verul and Karle. Some of his drawings 
are preserved in the Yale Centre of British 
Art of Yale University.
Exact portrayal of the object of the 
painting is characteristic of the European 
25
style. A number of renowned artists were 
trained in the J. J. School of Art and 
Industry, which was established in 1857 
C.E., offering courses in European style of 
painting. Pestonji Bomanji, an alumni of 
this school made replicas of Ajanta paintings.
Sculptural Art :  Sculptures are three 
dimensional, such as images, statues, pots 
and objects with artistic embellishment. 
For creating sculptures either rock or metal 
or clay is used. Rock 
sculptures are made by 
carving, metal sculptures 
are made with the help 
of moulds and clay 
sculptures are formed 
either directly with 
hands or by using 
moulds. The entire 
temple of Kailasa at 
Verul is a unique monolithic sculpture 
(carved out of a single rock). The lion 
capital of the Asokan pillar found at 
Sarnath, is the national emblem of India.
Folk Styles of Sculptural Art : 
The sculptural art is also as ancient 
as the art of painting, dating back to 
stone ages. Carving tools out of stone 
can said to be the beginning of 
sculptural art. The custom of making 
clay images for rituals has been 
prevalent in India since Harappan 
times. It has continued till today in 
many regions like Bengal, Bihar, 
Gujarat, Rajsthan, etc. The Ganesha idols, 
masks of Gauri, bull figurines made for 
the festival of Bailpola, wooden memorials, 
Veergals (memorial stones), the decorated 
clay storage bins, etc. are a few examples 
of the folk traditions of sculptural art.
Classical Styles of Sculptural Art  : 
The Harappan seals, stone and bronze 
statues tell us about the 5000 years old or 
even older tradition of the Indian tradition 
of sculptural art. It is said that the tradition 
of carving out stone sculptures of larger 
size began in the Mauryan period with the 
Asokan pillars.
The Sanchi stupa was erected in 
emperor Asoka’s time. However, the 
beautiful sculptural embellishments of the 
stupa are supposed to be later additions. 
The sculptures at Barhut are testimonies of 
the continuous development of sculptural 
art in India. 
Buddhism was 
spread far and 
wide, in many 
countries outside 
India. The 
tradition of 
erecting Buddhist 
stupas began in 
those countries as 
well. The stupa at 
Borobudur in Indonesia is the largest stupa 
in the world. It was built during the 8th-9th 
century C.E. It was declared as a World 
Heritage site in 1991.
Ashokstambh Barhut Stupa
Indian Iconography : The Gandhara 
school of art came into being in the 2nd 
century B.C.E. in Afghanistan and 
neighbouring regions. It had Greek and 
Persian influence.
The 1st-3rd century C.E., that is the 
Kushana period, saw the rise of Mathura 
school of art. The Mathura school laid 
the foundation of Indian iconography. 
Iconography is a branch of knowledge 
which includes everything about making 
Borobudur 
Stupa
26
of images of gods 
and goddesses.
The Kushana 
kings made use of 
images of various 
deities on their 
coins. During the 
period of Gupta 
empire the 
iconographic rules 
were formulated 
and standards for 
sculptural art were set.  The art of making 
bronze images was developed under the 
patronage of Chola kings during 9th-13th 
century. Bronze idols of Gods and 
goddesses like Siva-Parvati, Nataraj, 
Lakshmi, Vishnu, etc. were made in this 
period.
Architecture and Sculpture :  There 
are a number of rock-cut caves in India. 
The tradition of rock-cut caves originated 
in India in the 3rd century B.C.E. 
Technically the entire composition of a 
rock-cut cave represents a union of 
architecture and sculptural art. Its entrances, 
interiors with its carved columns and 
images are excellent specimens of sculptural 
art.  The paintings on the walls and ceiling 
have survived in some of the caves till 
today. The rock-cut caves at Ajanta and 
Verul in Maharashtra were declared as 
World Heritage in 1983. 
The temple architecture in India began 
to develop around 4th century C.E. during 
the Gupta period. The temples built at the 
beginning of the Gupta period had only the 
sanctum sanctorum (Garbhagriha) and a 
veranda with four columns.
The temple architecture in India had 
reached its 
peak by the 
8th century 
C.E. This is 
easily testified 
by the 
magnificent 
composition 
of the Kailas 
temple of 
Verul. By the medieval period various 
styles of temple architecture had developed 
in India.
The styles of temple architecture are 
identified by the style of the tower 
(Shikhara). The Nagara style of North 
India and the Dravida style of South India 
are the two principal styles of Indian 
temple architecture. A blend of these two 
styles is known as Vesara style. The 
Bhoomija style seen in Madhya Pradesh 
and Maharashtra has a close resemblance 
to the Nagara style from the structural 
viewpoint. In the Bhoomija style, series of 
miniature towers are arranged, which 
become smaller toward the top. Hence, the 
tower appears to be continuously rising 
from the base of the temple to the top.

Bijapur in Karnatak are the world famous 
examples of the Islamic architecture of 
India. The construction of the building of 
Kutub Minar started during the reign of 
Kutubuddin Aibak (12th century C.E.) 
and was completed in the reign of 
Altmash (13th century). Kutub Minar is 
the highest minaret in the world. It is 73 
meters (240 ft.) in height. The Kutub 
Minar complex of buildings has been 
declared as a World Heritage.
Temples in Maharashtra built in 
12th-13th centuries are known as 
Hemadpanti temples. The outer walls 
of Hemadpanti temples are built in a 
star shape. In the star-shaped plan, 
the outer walls of the temple has a 
zigzag design. This results into an 
interesting effect of alternating light 
and shadow. The important 
characteristic of  Hemadpanti temple 
is its masonry. The walls are built 
without using any mortar, by locking 
the stones by using the technique of 
tenon and mortise joints. The 
Ambreshwar temple at Ambarnath 
near Mumbai, Gondeshwar temple at 
Sinnar near Nashik, Aundha Nagnath 
temple in the Hingoli district are a 
few finest examples of the Hemadpanti 
style. Their plan is star-shaped. The 
Hemadpanti temples are found at 
several places in Maharashtra.

In the medieval period, under the 
patronage of Muslim sultanates many 
styles of architecture, such as Persian, 
Central Asian, Arabic and pre-Islamic 
native Indian styles were blended together 
creating the Islamic architecture of India. 
Many beautiful buildings were created.

The Gol Gumbaz at Bijapur in 
Karnatak was built in the 17th century 
C.E. This grand building houses the burial 
of Mohammed Adil Shah of Bijapur. Inside 
the dome, after which the building is 
named, there is a round gallery. Even a 
slight whisper by a person standing in this 
gallery can be heard everywhere and it 
somebody claps from here its echo can be 
heard many times.
Gol Gumbaz
During the British period a new 
architectural style arose in India. It is 
known as Indo-Gothic architectural style. 
Buildings like Churches, government 
offices, residences of top officials, 
railway stations were built in this style 
during the British period. The building of 
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Railway Terminus
‘Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Railway 
Terminus’, Mumbai is the finest example 
of the Indo-Gothic architecture and it is a 
World Heritage Site.
4.3 Indian traditions of Performing Arts
Traditions of Performing Folk Arts : 
India has independent and varied traditions 
of folk songs, folk instrumental music, 
folk dances and folk theatre, which are 
characteristic of every particular region. 
There exist many rich traditions of 
performing folk arts in Maharashtra also. 
They developed as an integral part of the 
religious festivals and social life. To 
name a few as examples, we may mention 
Koli Dance, Tarapa Dance, Dashavatar 
of Konkan, Powada, Keertan, Jagar-
Gondhal, etc.
Traditions of Classical Performing 
Arts : India has a rich heritage of Classical 
performing arts, too. The text of 
‘Natyashastra’ written by Bharatmuni is 
supposed to be the earliest one discussing 
music and theatre. The nine moods (nine 
rasas), supposed to be fundamental in the 
presentations of Indian performing arts 
are     : Shringar (love), Hasya (humour), 
Beebhatsa (repulsion), Raudra (terrible), 
Karuna (sad), Veer (heoroic),  Bhayanak 
(fearful), Adbhut (wondrous) and Shant 
(Peaceful).
Indian people came into contact with 
cultural traditions of other nations and that 
resulted into blending of many 
different streams in the presentation 
of Indian performing arts, enriching 
them over time.  As a result many 
styles of presenting of classical 
vocal music, instrumental music, 
and dance came into existence. 
Various schools preserving those 
styles were also created.
There are two main branches 
of the Indian classical music : 
29
In India in the post-independence 
period various festivals of music and dance 
are organised with a view to make it 
accessible to common people. Many people 
attend these festivals, including Indians 
and foreigners alike. The ‘Savai 
Gandharva’ festival of Pune is a famous 
one.
Lately, we can see an inclination 
toward experimenting and creating fusion 
of various music styles, by trying to 
overcome the limitations imposed by a 
traditional style or school. Pandit Uday 
Shankar is a prominent name among such 
artists who created a new style. He 
successfully created a fusion of Indian 
classical dance and European opera. He

Do you know ?
The ruler of Bijapur, Ibrahim 
Adilshah II wrote a text in Persian 
language, entitled ‘Kitab-e-Navras’. 
This text is about Indian classical 
music. It includes verses sung in 
the Dhrupad style and enables the 
audience to experience the joy of 
excellent poetry. Dr Arun Prabhune 
has edited this text in Marathi. 
The translation of the verse printed 
on the cover of this text reads as 
follows:
‘‘Oh, Mother Saraswati, you 
are the divine light in the world 
and you are complete with all 
qualities. If Ibrahim receives your 
grace (blessings), the poetry of the 
navras will become eternal.’’
‘Hindustani music’ and ‘Carnatic music’. 
Similarly there are two forms of it : 
Classical (shastriya) and semi-classical 
(upshastriya). The semi-classical has 
included many styles of folk music.
A beautiful blend of all three forms of 
music, vocal, instrumental and dance can 
be seen in various Indian classical dance 
forms like ‘Kathak of north India, ‘Lavani’ 
of Maharashtra, ‘Odisi’ of Odisha, 
‘Bharatnatyam’ of Tamilnadu and 
‘Kathakali’ and ‘Mohiniattam’ of Kerala.

also included various forms of folk dance 
in his style. Thus the scope of the 
presentation of Indian performing arts 
seems to be constantly expanding. The 
same phenomenon is apparent in the field 
of Indian visual arts.
4.4 Art, Applied Art and Professional 
Opportunities
Arts :  Art history is an independent 
branch of knowledge. Various opportunities 
of research are available in this field.
(1) Art historians can work in the 
field of journalism.
(2) Art market is an independent 
field. It calls for special expertise to 
assess the exact value of an art object or 
to ensure that it is genuine. An expert 
with deep understanding of art history is 
required for this task.
(3) Heritage Management and 
Cultural Tourism are recently developed 
fields. In these fields students of art can 
find many professional opportunities. 
Museums and Archives Management, 
Library Science and Information 
Technology, Archaeological Research, 
Indology are some important fields in this 
regard.
Applied Art : The visual and 
performing arts are primarily looked upon 
as the means of entertainment for people. 
The artist performs primarily with this 
purpose. However, there is a scope to 
combine an artistic creation with utility 
value to make it economically viable. 
Thus an artistic creation with a utilitarian 
purpose is called applied art.
(1) Industry and Advertisement; Interior 
Design and production of ornamental 
object; Art Design of stage Backdrops 
(Nepathya); Art Direction for Films 
and Televison; Creating attractive 
Layouts of books, magazins; 
Callligraphy; Production of greeting 
cards, invitation cards, customised 
stationary, gift objects; etc. are the 
fields of applied arts.
(2) The field of architecture, photography 
are also part of applied arts. Nowadays, 
still and animated graphics created 
with the help of computers are used 
for various purpose. This is also 
applied art. Ornaments, artistic 
creations of metals, earthen pots with 
colourful designs, objects made from 
cane and bamboo, beautiful glass 
objects, attractive textiles and clothing, 
etc. all can be listed under applied 
arts.
Every field mentioned above requires 
a detailed planning and meticulous 
management at every stage of production. 
It is essential to employ, trained and 
skilled individuals at every stage. Some 
of the production processes of artistic 
objects have a history of certain traditions. 
The development of each productive 
process has its own history. Hence the 
syllabi of training courses of art design 
include the history of various industrial 
and cultural traditions.
 There are a few institutions in 
India, which offer technical and 
occupational training in the above 
mentioned fields. Among them ‘National 
Institute of Design’ in  Ahmedabad, 
Gujarat is a world renowned institute. 
This institute has introduced an online 
course since 2015.
  In the next lesson, we will learn 
about mass media and history.

5. Mass Media and History
Newspapers : ‘Newspaper’ is a 
publication, which mainly prints news, 
editorials, people’s opinions, entertaining 
or other supplementary content. It is 
printed and distributed regularly at a 
definite time.
Newspapers provide various local, 
national and international news. 
Newspapers are historical documents, 
which record current events.
Precursors of Newspapers : Before 
the beginning of the common era there 
was a custom in Egypt of placing 
inscriptions with royal decrees at public 
place. Emperor Asoka also resorted to 
similar method to reach out to his subjects. 
In the Roman Empire, royal decrees were 
written on papers and those were 
distributed in all regions. They also 
contained the information of various 
events taking place in the nation and its 
capital. During Julius Caesar’s reign 
newspapers known as Acta Diurna, 
meaning acts of everyday, used to be 
placed, at public places in Rome. It was 
a very effective way of conveying royal 
commands to people. In the 7th century 
C.E. royal dictates were distributed among 
people at public places. In England hand-
outs used to be distributed occasionally, 
giving information about wars or important 
events. Travellers arriving from faraway 
would add spice to stories from those 
places and narrate it to local people. The 
ambassadors of a king posted at various 
places would send back important news 
to the royal court.
‘Bengal Gazette’ : The first English 
newspaper of India was printed on 29th 
 5.1 Introduction to Mass Media
Mass Media contains two words. 
‘Mass’ in this context means an 
aggregation of people. ‘Media’ means 
various modes of communication. Thus, 
mass media is a field of mass 
communication. We can easily send some 
information to a far away destination 
through a medium of communication. In 
the olden days, a crier would run in the 
streets beating drums and crying out 
important news according to the orders of 
the king. The news would spread among 
people by word of mouth.
5.2 History of Mass Media
Printing technology and newspapers 
were introduced in India after the arrival 
of the British. People started receiving 
printed news through newspapers. 
Newspapers became the first mass medium 
of circulating information and knowledge 
among people.
Think about it.
What could be the method of 
sending a news to Delhi if there were 
a famine in Bihar in the Mughal period ? 
How much time would it take for the 
aid to reach Bihar after the Badshah 
heard the news ?

‘Dnyanoday’ : ‘Dnyanoday’ printed 
the map of Asia in 1842 and the map of 
Europe in 1851. The honour of printing 
an illustration in an Indian newspaper for 
the first time, goes to Dnyanoday. The 
news of installation of telegraph, used for

representing the masses of the Indian 
society (Bahujansamaj), was started by 
Mahatma Jyotirao Phule’s close associate, 
Krishnarao Bhalekar.  We get to know

other alternative to television for watching 
an event as it actually happened. 
5.4 Critical understanding of the 
information received through Mass 
Media
Any information received through 
mass media needs to be reviewed critically. 
The news or information in the media may 
not always represent exact truth. We need 
to scan it very carefully. There is a very 
famous event of unauthentic information 
appearing in print in Germany. ‘Stern’, a 
German weekly magazine had purchased 
a number of so called handwritten diaries 
of Adolf Hitler. It sold them to various 
publication companies. The diaries were 
verified for their authenticity and 
subsequently the news appeared in the 
print. However, later those diaries were 
proved to be forged. It becomes apparent 
from this example that we need to be very 
careful about the information published by 
the media.
5.5 Mass Media and Professional 
Opportunities
Newspapers have to fulfil the task of 
providing fresh news to its readers. It is 
also necessary to unfold the background 
of an event in the news. At such times, 
newspapers have to resort to history. 
While reporting news in detail, reporters 
try to compare it with parallel events, 
which happened in the past. The past 
event may be printed in a separate frame.

awareness creating and literary 
programmes. It also broadcasts special 
programmes for farmers, workers, the 
youth and women. The ‘Vividh Bharati’ 
programmes are broadcasted in 24 regional 
languages as well as 146 dialects of 
Indian languages. Lately, various new 
channels like ‘Radio Mirchi’ are providing 
radio services. 
Television : The ‘Delhi Doordarshan 
Centre’ was inaugurated by Dr. Rajendra 
Prasad, the first Indian President. 
Doordarshan’s Mumbai centre began to 
telecast its programmes on 1st May 1972. 
Colour television was introduced on 15th 
August 1982. In 1991 the Indian 
government granted permission to private 
national and international channels to 
telecast in India. Thus, it  became possible 
for Indians to watch international events 
on television. 
5.3 Why do we need Mass Media ?
We need mass media to facilitate free 
flow of information to all strata of the 
society. Editorials, various columns and 
supplements are essential parts of 
newspapers. Readers are also ensured of 
a platform to voice their opinions. 
Newspapers can help in making the 
democracy stronger. 
Television is an audio-visual medium. 
It was possible for this medium to cross 
the inherent limitations of newspapers and 
the radio and show the actual visuals of 
an event to people. So far, there is no

Thus the reader gets access to additional 
information and he can get better insights 
about the current news.
Newspapers print columns about 
historical information, appearing under 
headings such as, ‘50 Years Ago’ or ‘100 
Years Ago’, etc.  Such columns are based 
on historical documents or written history. 
These columns provide historical 
information about economic, social, 
political events in the past and also events 
of historical significance.
History is also essential in planning 
radio programmes. For example, 
Akashvani has preserved recordings of all 
the speeches delivered each year by the 
prime ministers of India on 15th August. 
Akashvani invites historians as experts 
for discussions on various occasions such 
as the anniversaries of birth or death of 
national leaders, anniversaries of historical 
events, etc. Lectures on the contribution 
of various national leaders need to be 
supported by historical information. 
Programmes like ‘On This Day in History’ 
are also an integral part of the daily 
programmes of Akashvani.
Television channels also telecast 
programmes based on history. Doordarshan 
and other television channels help in 
creating interest in history among people 
through their historical shows and serials. 
The mythological and historical serials like 
‘Ramayana’, ‘Mahabharata’, ‘Bharat ek 
Khoj’ and ‘Raja Shivchhatrapati’ attracted 
a very large audience. While producing 
this type of programmes, maintaining 
accuracy with regard to the presentation of 
environment, outfits, weaponry, life styles, 
lingual expression, etc. is essential. One 
needs to have a deep understanding of 
history of the concerned period. 
Currently channels like ‘Discovery’, 
‘National Geographic’, ‘History’, etc. 
have opened a rich treasure of global 
history for the audience. It has enabled 
people to view the historical and 
geographic wonders at home. To make 
such programmes more entertaining some 
parts of the serial are actually enacted by 
actors such as the characters of heroic 
men and women, sportsmen, army chiefs, 
etc. Beside these serials about ancient 
monuments, forts, histories of empires and 
also the history of culinary arts are 
watched by a large number of people

Newspapers occasionally publish 
supplements to the regular edition or 
special issues. For example, World War  I 
commenced in 1914. Year 2014 marked 
the 100th year of this event. In order to 
be able to publish a newspaper supplement 
or a special issue to commemorate the 
occasion, one needs to review its history. 
In 2017, seventy five years were completed 
after the announcement of ‘Quit India’ 
movement.  On such occasions newspapers 
highlight the event through various articles, 
editorials, columns like ‘what happened 
in history on this day’, reviews, etc. The 
knowledge of history is essential for 
writings of such type.

‘Bharat Ek Khoj’, a serial telecasted 
by Doordarshan has a special place in 
the history of Indian television serials. 
It was based on ‘Discovery of India’, 
a book written by Pandit Jawaharlal 
Nehru. It was directed by Shyam 
Benegal. This serial presented the 
history of India from the ancient to the 
modern period, throwing light on 
social, cultural and political history of 
respective periods.

Mauryan period, Turk-Afghan 
invasions, Mughal period and the 
contributions of Mughal emperors, 
Bhakti Movement, Role of Chhatrapati 
Shivaji Maharaj, movements of social 
reform and Indian struggle for 
independence, etc.
Roshan Seth, the actor who played 
Pandit Nehru’s role in this serial also 
appeared as a narrator, introducing 
and explaining various parts of the 
story by dramatising them, using 
folklore and informative speeches. The 
serial was admired in all parts of India 
because of the comprehensive historical 
perspective of Pandit Nehru and its 
equally comprehensive visual

6. Entertainment and History
Things that help refresh our minds 
and give a feeling of happiness are the 
sources of entertainment. Various hobbies, 
games, drama-film, writing-reading, etc. 
are the sources of entertainment.
6.1 Why do we need Entertainment ?
Healthy entertainment of excellent 
quality is essential for the healthy growth 
of one’s personality. Entertainment keeps 
our minds lively and fresh. It may 
also make us feel physically more 
energetic. So eventually our 
efficiency at work improves. 
Pursuing hobbies and games helps 
in personality development. In 
India many festivals, sports, dance-
music, etc. were developed as 
forms of entertainment since 
ancient times.
There are varied forms of 
entertainment available in the 
modern period as well.

been found in the excavations of 
archaeological sites of Harappan 
civilisation as well as sites in Egypt and 
Greece. It is possible that they were used 
as puppets.
In ancient India materials like wood, 
wool, leather, horns and ivory were used 
to make puppets. The Kathputali, a 
traditional art of puppetry in India has two 
styles; one that developed in Rajasthan 
40
and the other in southern regions of India.
The artists who stage Kathputali shows 
are found in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, 
Rajasthan, Assam, West Bengal, Andhra 
Pradesh, Telangana, Karnatak and Kerala. 
The role of the narrator known as 
sutradhara is very crucial in the success 
of Kathaputali stage show. The stage for 
this puppetry show is quite small but the 
puppeteers use light and sound effects in 
an ingenious way. Shadow puppets, hand 
puppets, wooden puppets and string puppets 
are used in Kathputali shows.
Dashavatara Theatre : Dashavatara is 
part of the folk theatre in Maharashtra. 
Dashavatara shows are presented in the 
regions of Konkan and Goa after harvesting 
season is over. The stories presented in 
these shows are based on the 10 incarnations 
of Vishnu, namely Matsya, Koorma, Varaha, 
Narsimha, Wamana, Parashurama, Ram, 
Krishna, Buddha and Kalki. At the beginning 
of the show sutradhara, the narrator invokes 
Lord Ganesha, the destroyer of obstacles.
In the 18th century Shyamji Naik Kale 
started a phad*, of Dashavatara artists 
which used to perform all over Maharashtra.
Vishnudas Bhave, the pioneer of 
Marathi theatre staged mythological plays 
by introducing some modifications in the 
Dashavatara style. Thus, the origins of the 
Marathi theatre can be traced to 
Dashavatara tradition.
*The meaning of phad is ‘a troupe’.
Bhajan (singing devotional songs) : 
To sing songs in praise of God and 
chanting god’s name accompanied by 
instruments like taal (cymbals), mridangam, 
pakhavaj is known as Bhajan. There are 
two types of Bhajan, Chakri Bhajan and 
Songi Bhajan.
Chakri Bhajan : Devotees keep moving 
in circular fashion and sing without break.
Songi Bhajan : The singer-actors act 
as devotees and deliver dialogues in the 
form of devotional songs.
Tukadoji Maharaj introduced a new 
form of Bhajan known as Khanjiri Bhajan.

traditional singer.
Do this.
The method of acting, make-up, 
costumes in Dashavatara shows is set by 
the tradition. The show is mostly musical 
but sometimes there may be a few 
spontaneous dialogues. The characters 
representing gods use wooden masks. The 
show ends by breaking dahihandi, an 
earthen pot of curds, followed by aarati, 
singing praises of the God.
In north India the bhajans composed 
by Saint Tulsidas, the great poet Surdas, 
Saint Meerabai and Saint Kabir are very 
popular.
Compositions of Purandardas, 
Kanakdas, Vijaydas, Bodhendraguruswami, 
Thyagaraj, etc. are sung in Karnatak.
In Gujarat Saint Narasi Mehta gave 
momentum to the Bhakti movement. In 
Maharashtra, Saint Namadeva supported

instruments, dance and humour. He needs 
to be very well informed. Keertan is 
performed in a temple or in the precincts 
of a temple.
Lalit : Lalit is an old form of 
entertainment in Maharashtra. It belongs 
to the tradition of Naradiya Keertan. It is 
quite popular in Goa and Konkan.
During the performance of Lalit on the 
occasion of religious festivals, it is 
presumed that the presiding deity of that 
festival is present on the throne and then 
she is invoked for fulfilment of a desire. 
The invocation continues as follows : “Let 
everybody be granted their desire. Let 
entire village live in happiness till we 
perform next Lalit. Let the internal 
clashes vanish with this performance of 
Lalit. Let nobody’s mind be spoilt with 
prejudice. Let all transactions happen 
with clear minds. Let the community’s 
behaviour be pious.”
The Lalit is performed in a theatrical 
style. Stories of Krishana, Rama and great 
devotees are presented during the 
performance. A few texts of Lalit are 
available in Hindi as well. Lalit forms a 
part of the backdrop of modern Marathi 
theatre.
Bharud : Bharud can be described as 
a metaphorical song that has spiritual and 
ethical lessons. Bharud is comparable to 
the style of a road show. Bharuds composed 
by Saint Eknath are popular in Maharashtra 
because of its wide range of subjects, 
dramatic quality, easy rhythm and humour. 
Saint Eknath composed Bharuds with a 
purpose of educating people on various 
aspects of life. 
Tamasha : Tamasha is a Persian 
word. It means a ‘pleasing sight’. Tamasha 
developed as an independent art form in 
the 18th century, by absorbing various 
traits of folk theatre and classical arts. 
You would like to know this :
There are two main traditions of 
keertan, (1) Naraadiya or Haridasi 
(2) Varakri. Haridasi keertan is a solo 
performance. It has two parts, Poorvarang 
and Uttarrang. Naman (praising god), 
Nirupanacha Abhang (singing a 
composition that leads to the main theme) 
and Nirupan (explanation of the main 
theme) comprise the Poorvarang. 
Narration of a story to illustrate the main 
theme comprises Uttarrang. In the 
Varkari Keertan collective participation 
is more important. The players of cymbals 
also play an important part along with 
the keertankar. During the independence 
movement a new type of Keertan was 
developed, known as Rashtriya Keertan. 
It places more importance on creating 
awareness by narrating the life stories of 
great leaders of the Indian independence 
movement, scientists, social reformers, 
etc. The tradition of Rashtriya Keertan 
was started by Dattopant Patwardhan of 
Wai in Maharashtra.
Members of the Satyashodhak Samaj 
founded by Mahatma Jyotirao Phule also 
used Keertan as a medium of creating 
social awareness. The style of Keertan by 
Saint Gadge Maharaj resembled closely 
to Satyashodhak style of Keertan. He 
used to throw light on issues like abolition 
of caste, cleanliness, deaddiction, etc.
sect developed a glorious tradition of 
bhajan-keertan.
Keertan :  Traditionally, Naradmuni 
is supposed to be the founder of the 
Keertana tradition. Saint Namadev is 
known as the first keertankar of 
Maharashtra. Other saints helped the 
tradition to flourish.
The keertankar is also known as 
Haridas or Kathekaribuva. He has to dress 
in a traditional way. He needs to train 
himself in oratory, singing, musical

as well as the audience is essential for a 
successful performance. The theatre 
comprises several factors such as script, 
director, artists, make-up, costumes, stage, 
art design (backdrop of the stage), lighting 
arrangement, audience and critics. Dance 
and music can also be part of a drama. A 
drama is usually enacted with the help of 
dialogues. However, mime can also be 
used as the medium of expression. 
The rulers of the Bhosale family of 
Tanjore were great patrons of drama. 
Some of them had written a few plays 
and also translated Sanskrit plays. The 
19th century saw a great development of 
the Marathi thetre. Vishnudas Bhave is 
known as the father of the Marathi 
theatre. Seetaswayamvar was the first 
play presented by him.
The movement started by Vishnudas 
Bhave was followed in Maharashtra by 
historical, mythological and also light 
farcical stage plays. The farcical plays 
dealt with social issues in a humorous way.
Initially no written scripts were used. 
Often, only the lyrics were written down 
but the dialogues used to be spontaneous. 
V.J. Kirtane was the first author who wrote 
the script of Thorale Madhavrao Peshwe 
in 1861 and its printed copy was made 
available. This was the beginning of the 
tradition of having a complete written 
script ready before staging a play.
In the latter half of the 19th century, 
Balkrishnbuva Ichalkaranjikar made 
special efforts to introduce classical khyal 
music in Maharashtra. After him Ustad 
Alladiya Khan, Ustad Abdul Karim Khan 
and Ustad Rahimatkhan contributed in a 
great way. Their efforts helped in developing 
a taste for classical music among the 
audience in Maharashtra. The growing 
popularity of classical music resulted in 
the origin of musical Marathi theatre. The 
musical plays of Kirloskar Mandali became

There are two types of traditional Tamasha, 
Sangeet Bari and Dholakicha Phad. Dance 
and music are more important than drama 
in a Sangeet Bari.  Tamasha with drama 
as the main part, was developed later. It 
included Vag, the dramatic part, little 
later. The Vag becomes very lively and 
entertaining because of its spontaneous 
humour. The show begins by singing the 
praise of Lord Ganesha, known as Gana. 
It is followed with the presentation of 
Gavalan. The second part of Tamasha 
presents the Vag. The popular plays like 
Vichchha Mazi Puri Kara or Gadhavache 
Lagna are examples of the modern form 
of Tamasha.
Powada : Powada is a dramatic 
narration by alternatingly reciting poetry 
and prosaic extracts. Powada narrates 
great deeds of heroic men and women in 
a very forceful and inspiring style. The 
Powada composed by Adnyandas, a 
contemporary poet of Chhatrapti Shivaji 
Maharaj, narrating the incidence of the 
killing of Afzal Khan and another one on 
the battle of Simhagarh, composed by 
Tulasidas, are two well-known examples 
of Powada.
In the British period, Powadas narrating 
the stories of Umaji Naik, Chapekar 
brothers, Mahatma Gandhi were composed. 
During the ‘Samyukt Maharashtra’ 
movement the powadas were used as a 
medium of creating public awareness.

the flora and fauna, social life, culture 
and trade systems of Asia.
Ibn Batuta, the traveller of the 
14th century took the world on a 
virtual travel of the Islamic world 
with his travel accounts. He was 
travelling for 30 years. He had 
resolved not to travel twice on the 
same route. His accounts are helpful 
in understanding  the medieval history 
and social life.

8.2 Types of Tourism
These days tourism has become an 
independent field of local, interstate, 
national and international business. The 
desire to visit national and international 
monuments, places of historical importance 
and natural beauty, ancient centres known 
for handicrafts, pilgrim centres, industrial 
centres and sites of various developmental 
projects, etc. promotes tourism. Tourists 
from all over the world wish to visit 
natural and manmade sites, which offer 
a delightful and awe inspiring experience. 
The places like snow-capped peaks, 
beaches, pristine jungles, which were 
neglected previously, became important 
locations of tourist interests. Mass media 
began to make special audio-visual 
presentations highlighting places of tourist 
interest. Tourism can be broadly typified 
into local tourism, interstate tourism, 
international tourism, religious tourism, 
historical tourism, health tourism, science 
tourism, agro-tourism, sports tourism, 
tourism based on special events, etc.
Local and Interstate Tourism : This 
kind of tourism is not very overwhelming 
because it is within one’s own country. It 
does not cause difficulties of language, 
procuring currency and documents. More 
so, we can plan it at the time suitable 
to us.
International Tourism : Nowadays, it 
has become easier to travel because of the 
easy availability of a number of options 
of railway, marine and air transport. 
Marine transport has linked the coastal 
regions. There is a trans-European railway 
route. Aviation has brought the entire 
world closer. Because of the economic 
liberalisation policy of the Indian 
government the number of people travelling 
back and forth from India has increased 
considerably. They include people travelling 
for studies, relaxation, sightseeing, and 
professional assignments (meetings, 
agreements, etc.), also for shooting of 
films, etc. One needs to procure various 
official documents for travelling abroad.
Historical Tourism : This type of 
tourism is popular all over the world. Tours 
to historical places are arranged to satisfy 
people’s interest in history. It can be noted 
in this context that Gopal Neelkanth 
Dandekar, a renowned Marathi writer used 
to arrange hiking tours to forts in 
Maharashtra, to explore the sights closely 
linked to Chhatrapti Shivaji Maharaj and 
his achievements. Tours are also arranged 
to important historical sites in India such 
as forts in Rajasthan, Ashrams of Mahatma 
Gandhi and Acharya Vinoba Bhave, 
Do you know ?
The tradition of travelling from 
corner to corner was prevalent in India 
from ancient times. Vishnubhat Godase 
wrote down the accounts of his journey 
from Maharashtra to Ayodhya and 
back to Maharashtra. It is published 
as a book entitled, ‘Maza Pravas’. 
Vishnubhat travelled during times of 
the Indian war of independence in 
1857.  He was the eye witness for 
many events related to this historical 
event. His accounts are full of detailed 
descriptions about various incidences 
during this period, especially those 
about the life of Lakshmibai, the 
queen of Jhansi.  We also get to know 
the nature of Marathi language of the 
18th century. This book is one of the 
important sources of history of that 
period.
Eventually he established a travel agency 
selling tourist tickets. This early venture 
of Thomas cook opened doors for the 
development of modern tourism.

important places related to the Indian war 
of independence in 1857, etc.
to India to avail of the medical facilities 
and health services. India is a tropical 
country, where ample sunlight is available 
throughout the year. This attracts tourist 
from countries with cold climate to India. 
Availability of facilities for Yoga training 
and therapies based on Ayurveda is one 
more reason to want to visit India. 
Agro-Tourism : Agro-tourism, which 
is also known as agri-tourism, is rapidly 
developing, especially meant for the urban 
population, which has very little exposure 
to rural life and agriculture. Now, Indian 
farmers are also visiting faraway places 
like agricultural research centres, 
agricultural universities, and countries like 
Israel where experimentation in advanced 
technology of agriculture is carried out.
Sports Tourism : Sports tourism was 
developed in the 20th century. There are 
various sports events organised on 
international level like Olympics, 
Wimbldon, World Chess Championship 
and international cricket tournaments, etc. 
While there are events like Himalayan Car 
Rally on national level, events like 
Maharashtra Kesari Wrestling competitions 
are organised on state level. Travelling to 
attend such events comes under sports 
tourism. 
Tourism based on Special Events : 
People want to travel and they are often on 
the lookout for special reasons to do it. In 
the 21st century it has become common to 
organise such events, which also help to 
You would like to know this : 
People of various religious 
communities are dispersed globally. 
However, they feel united because of 
their mythological traditions and the 
places associated with those traditions. 
This creates a desire to travel to those 
places and it gives rise to religious 
tourism. In this context the constructions, 
undertaken by Ahilyabai Holkar spending 
from her personal funds are noteworthy. 
Ahalyabai wanted to provide good 
amenities on the pilgrim routes like 
Chardham Yatras and Bara Jyotirlingas. 
Valley of Flowers
Let us find out : 
Apart from the types of tourism 
mentioned above, there are other types 
like, science tourism, leisure and 
relaxation tourism also known as 
wellness tourism, cultural tourism and 
group tourism, etc. Let us find more 
about it with the help of the teachers 
and internet.
Geographic Tourism  : This type of 
tourism involves visiting places to observe 
special geographic features of a region. It 
includes various natural and animal 
sanctuaries, places like valley of flowers 
(Uttarakhand), various beaches, unique 
geographical wonders like the crater lake 
at Lonar and ranjankhalage (naturally 
carved out cavities in rocks) at Nighoj in 
Maharashtra. Many tourists like to visit 
these places to satisfy their curiosity.
Health Tourism : People from the 
western countries find the health services 
and facilities in India comparatively 
cheaper and yet of good standard. 
Hence, many foreigners preferred to come

examples of such special events. People 
keep visiting several places to attend such 
special events. Many literature enthusiasts 
in Maharashtra travel every year to attend 
‘Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan’ 
(Pan Indian Marathi Literary Convention).
8.3 Development of Tourism
The crucial issue in the development 
of tourism is providing proper guidance to 
national and international tourists about 
various aspects of the actual travel, proper 
social conduct during the tour and during 
their stay at the destination places.
Giving priority to ensure safe transport 
and security facilities for the tourists, 
amenities of reasonably good standard, 
availability of good accommodation, good 
washroom facilities on the travel routes is 
of great significance in promoting tourism. 
It is also very important to pay special 
attention to the special needs of handicapped 
tourists. 
It is important to take a few primary 
precautions in order to preserve the 
historical heritage sites. It is essential 
that few things should be avoided at 
any instance, for example: vandalising 
or defacing the heritage monuments 
and sites. In order to avoid it everybody 
should refrain from activities like 
writing on walls or carving on trees, 
paint ancient monuments in garish 
colours, etc. Lack of good amenities in 
the precincts of the heritage sites causes 
filthiness.
It is very essential for the tourists 
that pamphlets, guides and history 
56
8.4 Conservation and Preservation of 
Heritage
It is a hard task to preserve and 
conserve heritage sites. Our country is very 
rich with historical sites dating to ancient, 
medieval and modern period. It is also 
blessed with abundance of nature.
Heritage of any country is divided 
into, Natural Heritage and Cultural 
(manmade) Heritage. There are some 
Heritage Sites in India, which are acclaimed 
globally, such as Taj Mahal at Agra, 
Jantar Mantar observatory at Jaipur, and 
also the rock-cut caves at Ajanta, Verul 
and Gharapuri (Elephanta), Chhatrapati 
Shivaji Maharaj Railway Terminus in 
Maharashtra. Kas Plateau in Maharashtra 
is located in the Western Ghats, which is 
a World Natural Heritage site.
There are tourists all over the world, 
who wish to visit world heritage sites. 
Foreign tourists come in large numbers to 
visit the heritage sites in our country. It 
makes us feel very proud when an Indian 
heritage site is declared as a world heritage 
site. However, whenever we visit such 
places we feel very disappointed because 
of what we see there. We get to see that 
people have written their names with 
charcoal; have drawn pictures, vandalising 
the heritage site. It affects our image as a 
nation. To preserve the heritage sites we 
need to resolve that :
(1) I shall strive to maintain the 
cleanliness of heritage sites.
(2) I shall not do anything, which will 
result in vandalising of any historical site.
8.5 Professional Opportunities in the 
Tourism and Hospitality Industry  
Tourism and Hospitality is an industry 
with potential to create maximum 
employment opportunities. If managed 
professionally, it is a very stable industry. 
Heritage Walks : To go on a tour 
for visiting historical places is known as 
‘Heritage Walk’.  One can experience 
the thrill of being a part of history by 
participating in heritage walks.
‘Heritage Walks’ as an organised 
group activity has gained popularity in 
many countries. India has a rich history, 
which can be traced back to many 
millenniums. Every region of India is full 
of historical places from ancient, medieval 
and modern period. The ‘Heritage walk’ 
organised in the city of Ahmedabad is 
well-known. In the cities of Mumbai and 
Pune in Maharashtra such walks are 
organised regularly. Heritage walks can 
encourage people to support projects like 
conservation and preservation of historical 
monuments, to collect authentic 
information about them and to publish it 
through various media. Residences of 
renowned citizens who have passed away 
are also part of heritage. In some cities 
‘blue plaques’ with the names and other 
relevant information of such citizens are 
placed on their residences, as a part 
heritage scheme.
It has tremendous scope for experimentation 
and innovation.
A good number of opportunities of 
employment are available in the tourism 
and hospitality industry. The country 
which is a tourist destination begins to 
receive revenue even before a tourist 
arrives at the airport of that country. He 
has to pay for his visa. He spends for 
his travel, stay in hotels, food, payment

to translators and guides, buying 
newspapers, reference books, souvenirs, 
etc. This contributes to the growth of 
economy of that country.
Markets in the vicinity grow along 
with the development of a tourist centre. 
Hence, the local handicrafts and cottage 
industries also begin to develop. The 
demand for locally processed food items 
and ethnic handicrafts increases. It results 
in better income for local artisans, business 
people and wage earners.
Development of Tourism in 
Maharashtra : Maharashtra is a state 
blessed with rich heritage. The much-
admired rock-cut caves, paintings and 
sculptures of Ajanta, Verul and Gharapuri 
(Elephanta); pilgrim centres like Dehu, 
Alandi, Jejuri, Pandharpur, Shirdi, 
Shegaon, Tulajapur, Kolhapur, Nashik, 
Tryambakeshwar, Paithan, Haji Malang,

Church in Mumbai, etc.; hill stations like 
Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani, Khandala, 
Lonavala, Matheran, Chikhaldara, etc.; 
dams at Koyananagar, Jayakwadi, 
Bhatghar, Chandoli, etc. and  sanctuaries 
at Dajipur, Sagareshwar, Tadoba, etc. are 
among the important tourist centres in 
Maharashtra.
The Maharashtra Tourism 
Development Corporation was set up in 
1975.  It helped in the development of 
tourism in Maharashtra. The corporation 
has provided facilities of tourist hotels at 
47 places. Together these hotels can 
accommodate more than 4000 tourists. 
Many private entrepreneurs are also 
providing hospitality services to tourists.

Bhilar is a village near 
Mahabaleshwar, which boasts of natural 
beauty and sweetness of 
strawberry. It is also 
known as the ‘Village of 
Books’. Every household 
in this village maintains 
a library of its own for 
the tourists to enjoy. 
Maharashtra State 
Government has implemented this scheme 
An unusual Village of Books
with a view to accelerate the ‘Reading 
Culture’ movement for the reader-tourists 
to enjoy the beauty of Marathi literature 
enriched by the works of old and new 
authors and saints. It includes various

tourists. Horsekeepers provide horses for 
horse rides and horse cart rides. It is 
the local people who are engaged in 
these activities and they can earn good 
money for their services. In short tourism 
becomes a major source of their 
livelihood.

9. Heritage Management
The sources of history and all the 
history books that are available today are 
the results of the diligent work of several 
historians. Institutes like libraries, museums 
and archives conserve and preserve this 
precious historical heritage. They choose 
important specimens from the heritage 
collection and exhibit them. They also 
publish research journals, informative 
pamphlets, leaflets, posters, etc.
The documents and artefacts which 
are not exhibited but historically very 
important, are stored in the museums and 
archives after completing necessary 
treatments for their conservation and 
preservation. Those documents and 
artefacts are made available to researchers, 
as and whenever necessary. Libraries 
conserve, preserve and manage the books.

9.2 Some Famous Museums
Museums were created to organise 
and manage the antiquities collected by 
members of royal and elite families of 
medieval Europe.
Louvre Museum, France : The 
Louvre Museum in Paris was established 
in the 18th century C.E. Antiquities 
collected by members 
of the royal family 
were exhibited in the 
Louvre  museum. It 
included the much 
acclaimed painting 
of ‘Monalisa’ by 
Leonardo da Vinci, 
the world renowned 
artist.  He worked 
under the patronage 
of Francis I, the king 
of France in the 16th century. The 
collection in the Louvre museum increased 
to a great extent because of the antiquities 
brought back by Napoleon Bonaparte 
from his conquests. Presently, the museum 
contains more than 3 lakhs and 80 
thousand artefacts.
British Museum, England :  The 
British Museum in London was established 
in the 18th century C.E. Sir Hans Sloan 
a natural scientist handed over about 71 
thousand objects in his collection to the 
king of England, George II. It included 
several books, pictures, specimens of 
preserved plants (herbarium), etc. Later 
the collection was expanded by addition 
of various art objects and ancient artefacts 
collected by the British people from 
Monalisa
61
National Museum of natural History, 
United States of America : This museum 
of natural history managed by the 
Smithsonian Institution was established in 
1846 C.E. It houses more than 12 crore 
(120 millions) specimens of fossils and 
remains of plants and animals, minerals, 
rocks, human fossils and artefacts.
Delhi, in 1949. Presently, there are several 
museums in various states of India. 
Usually the big museums have their own 
archives and libraries. Some museums are 
affiliated to universities. Such museums 
also offer courses in Museology.
Following are some of the well-
known institutes and universities, which 
offer degree and diploma courses in 
museology : 
British Museum, England
British colonies. Presently the museum 
collection comprises about 80 lakh objects.

Museums in India : The first museum 
in India, ‘Indian Museum’, was established 
by ‘Asiatic Society of Bengal’ in Kolkata, 
in 1814 C.E. The second museum in 
India, ‘Government Museum’ was 
established in Chennai, in 1851 C.E.  The 
‘National Museum’ was established in 
Chhatrapti Shivaji Maharaj 
Vastusangrahalay :  In 1904 
C.E. some influential residents 
of Mumbai decided to establish 
a museum to commemorate the 
visit of Prince of Wales to India. In the 
month of November of 1905 C.E. the 
foundation was laid of the museum 
building. It was decided that the name of 
the museum would be ‘Prince of Wales 
Museum of Western India’. It was 
renamed as ‘Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 
Vastusangrahalay’, in 1998 C.E.
62
The building of the museum is built 
in Indo-Gothic style. It has been given 
the status of Grade I Heritage Building 
in Mumbai. The museum houses about 50 
thousand antiquities divided into three 
categories, Arts, Archaeology and Natural 
History.
9.3 Libraries and Archives
Libraries are the storehouses of 
knowledge and information. Library Science 
is very closely related to Management 
Science, Information Technology and the 
field of Education. Libraries perform 
various tasks like collecting books, arranging 
them systematically, conservation and 
preservation of those books, dissemination 
of information sources, etc. Many of these 
tasks are completed with the help of 
computerised systems. To make a book 
available to a reader as per his requirement 
is the most important aspect of library 
management.
The Royal Library of Ashurbanipal 
(7th century B.C.E.), the Assyrian Emperor 
in Mesopotamia; the library at Takshashila 
University (5th century B.C.E.- 5th century 
C.E.) and  the library in Alexandria, 
Egypt (4th century B.C.E.) are supposed 
to be the earliest libraries in the world.
The ‘Saraswati Mahal Granthalay’ in 
Thanjavur, Tamilnadu was built in 
16th-17th century, during the times of 
Nayak dynasty. In 1675 C.E. 
Vyankojiraje Bhosale conquered 
Thanjavur and established his 
independent rule. Vyankojiraje Bhosale 
and his successors kept expanding 
‘Saraswati Mahal Granthalay’. 
Sarfojiraje Bhosale contributed the 
most in this expansion. In 1918 the 
library was renamed as ‘The 
Thanjavur Maharaja Sarfoji’s 
Saraswati Mahal Library’ in his 
honour.
There are several noteworthy libraries 
in India, for instance, National Library, 
Kolkata; Nehru Memorial Museum and 
Library, Delhi; State Central Library, 
Hyderabad; Library of Asiatic Society 
and David Sassoon Library, Mumbai, etc. 
From the technical point of view the 
management of archives is akin to library 
management. Preserving documents with 
important content in their original condition, 
preparing indexes and creating accurate 
systems of retrieval of documents are the 
important tasks in the management of 
archives. Documents from the archives are 
supposed to be very reliable. Because of 
the heavy dependency on computerised 
systems information technology has 
become an inevitable part of  the 
management of libraries and archives.
The first official archives of India, 
the ‘Imperial Record Department’, was 
established in 1891 C.E. in Kolkata. It 
was shifted to Delhi in 1911 C.E.
In 1998 C.E. the then President of 
India, Honourable K.R. Narayanan opened 
the archives for public. It is a department 
under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of 
Culture of the Indian Government. The 
documents have been preserved here in a 
chronological order from 1748. It includes 
Chhatrapti Shivaji Maharaj Vastusangrahalay
63
records in English, Arabic, Hindi, Persian, 
Sanskrit and Urdu languages. It also 
includes records in Modi script. These 
records are classified in four categories : 
Public records, Oriental Studies, 
Manuscripts and Private Records.
Governments of every State in India 
maintain independent archives. The 
Archives of Maharashtra State Government 
has branches in Mumbai, Pune, Kolhapur, 
Aurangabad and Nagpur. There are about 
5 crore modi documents related to Maratha 
history in the Pune branch. These documents 
are referred to as ‘Peshwa Daftar’.
9.4 Encyclopaedias
Encyclopaedia is a systematic 
compilation of information or knowledge 
of various topics. The information or 
knowledge in encyclopaedia is arranged 
with a specified method.  Organising 
available knowledge and making it 
accessible is the main objective of 
encyclopaedias.
Benefits of Encyclopaedia : 
Encyclopaedias make vast volume of 
knowledge accessible to readers. It can 
help in satisfying their curiosity. 
Encyclopaedias provide fundamental 
information on any topic, in order to 
understand it properly. Thus, the reader 
gets motivated to read extensively. 
Encyclopaedias make the existing 
knowledge easily accessible to scholars 
and researchers and also highlight the 
research areas, which have not yet received 
enough attention. Encyclopaedias are 
indicators of the state of cultural ripeness 
of a society. The intellectual and cultural 
needs of a society determine what kind of 
encyclopaedic literature would be created.
Accuracy, meticulousness, objectivity, 
standardised format of presentation and 
updated information are the criteria for 
designing a structure of an encyclopaedia. 
In order to incorporate the latest available 
information revised editions of 
encyclopaedias or supplements to original 
editions need to be published. 
Encyclopaedias are arranged either in 
alphabetical order or according to the 
order of topics. The type of order is 
decided by keeping the convenience of 
readers in mind and the ease of 
accessibility to the information. An index 
at the end of the encyclopaedia is very 
convenient in this regard.
The encyclopaedia can be created 
either by a single editor or an editorial 
committee. The articles in the 
encyclopaedia are written by subject 
experts.
Types of Encyclopaedia : 
Encyclopaedias can be approximately 
divided into four types. (1) Dictionaries 
(2) Comprehensive Encyclopaedia 
(Vishwakosh) (3) Encyclopaedic 
(Koshsadrush) literature (4) Indexes
(1) Dictionaries : Dictionaries 
arrange the words in a language in certain 
order (alphabetical order is more common). 
It gives meanings of words, synonyms and 
etymology. There are various types of 
dictionaries : comprehensive dictionaries, 
dictionaries which include only certain 
type of words, dictionaries of terminology 
(deals with terms peculiar to a branch of 
knowledge), etymological dictionaries, 
thesaurus, dictionaries of idioms and 
proverbs, etc.
(2) Comprehensive Encyclopaedia 
(Vishwakosh) :  There are two types of 
Vishwakosh. (a) It includes all subjects 
under the sun (for example, ‘Encyclopaedia 
Britannica’, ‘Maharashtriya Dnyankosh’, 
‘Marathi Vishvakosh’, etc.) (b) It includes 
comprehensive information on one chosen 
64
subject. For example, ‘Bharatiya Samskruti 
Kosh’, ‘Vyayam Dnyankosh’, etc.
(3) Encyclopaedic (Koshsadrush) 
Literature : It is similar to an 
encyclopaedia which comprises scholarly 
articles providing information on all 
possible aspects of one or more 
predetermined subjects. For example, 
‘Maharashtra Jeevan’, Vol. I and II; 
‘Shahar Pune’, Vol. I and II; ‘Yearbook’ 
(Manorama, Times of India), etc.
(4) Indexes : Indexes usually occur 
at the end of a book. There are a few 
indexes published separately. Indexes are 
the alphabetical lists of individuals, 
subjects, places, key words, reference 
books, etc. For example, the index of 
Marathi periodicals prepared by S.G.Date. 
Indexes are helpful in finding required 
information and it makes the information 
in a book easily accessible.
Encyclopaedia and History : 
Encyclopaedia and history as academic 
exercises, put stress on objectivity. 
Encyclopaedias published in various 
countries and in various languages may 
differ in their approach because of 
different priorities. Their structure is 
influenced by national policies, ethical 
values and ideals. Encyclopaedias can be 
a medium of strengthening national 
identity. For example ‘Bharaiya Samskruti 
Kosh’ edited by Mahadevshastri Joshi. 
Making knowledge in all spheres of life 
accessible to everybody, can be one of 
the major drives behind the creation of 
encyclopaedias. An inspiration to gain 
and spread knowledge motivates either 
individuals or a group of people to create 
encyclopaedias. Hence encyclopaedias are 
looked upon as outstanding achievements 
of a society. It is the manifestation of the 
collective intellect and creativity of a 
society.
Encyclopaedias on History-related 
Subjects : There is a rich tradition of 
creating encyclopaedias on history-related 
subjects. ‘Bharatvarshiya Prachin Aitihasik 
Kosh’ by Raghunath Bhaskar Godbole 
(1876) is the earliest encyclopaedia of 
this kind. It includes information about 
various individuals and places in Ancient 
India. According to the editor, ‘Those 
individuals who lived in Bharatvarsha, 
earned a name for themselves and were 
part of us along with their women, their 
sons, their religions, their lands and 
capitals, also the rivers and mountains in 
their lands….whatever their history’ is 
given in this encyclopaedia.
Twenty three volumes of 
‘Maharashtriya Dnyankosh’, edited by 
Shridhar Vyankatesh Ketkar are available. 
The major drive for Ketkar in creating it, 
was to facilitate wider access to 
knowledge, and to expand the intellectual 
sphere of Marathi speaking people. His 
was far-reaching view of history, which 
is reflected in these volumes.

The following are the early 
encyclopaedias :

65
‘Bharatvarshiya Charitrakosh’ is 
another important encyclopaedia. 
Siddheshwarshastri Chitrav established a 
committee, known as ‘Bharatiya 
Charitrakosh Mandal’ for publishing this 
encyclopaedia. Three volumes were 
published, namely, ‘Bharatvarshiya 
Prachin Charitrakosh’ (1932), 
‘Bharatvarshiya Madhyayugin 
Charitrakosh’ (1937) and ‘Bharatvarshiya 
Arvachin Charitrakosh’ (1946). The first 
volume includes information on the lives 
of individuals mentioned in the Vedic 
literature including Shruti, Smruti, Sutras, 
Vedangas, Upanishads  also Puranas, 
Jain and Buddhist literature. Similarly 
other two volumes contain biographies of 
individuals in the respective periods.

about Maharashtra in those days. It also 
gives details about the time, place and 
background of the events described in 
‘Leelacharitra’. Hence, it is a very good 
source for writing about the life of 
Chakradhar Swami. 
(2) ‘Prachin Bharatiya 
Sthalakosh’ (1969) : Siddheshwarshstri 
Chitrav compiled this encyclopaedic book.

Samskruti Mandal, with a view to enhance 
the sphere of Marathi language and 
literature. The work was started under the 
guidance of Tarkteerth Lakshmanshastri 
Joshi. It contains knowledge about all 
possible subjects in the world. It also 
contains very important entries about 
history.
Bharaitya Samskruti Kosh : Ten 
volumes of ‘Bharatiya Samsksruti Kosh’ 
were edited and  published by 
Mahadevshastri Joshi. These volumes 
contain information about Indian history, 
geography, various ethnic and lingual 
groups, local history of those groups, their 
festivals and other cultural aspects.

Competency Statements

The textbooks of Political Science till 
now have helped us to take an overview 
of local government, the values and the 
philosophy of the Indian Constitution as 
also the governing structures created by 
the Constitution and India’s place in 
international relations. The Indian 
Constitution has declared its objective to 
establish a secular, democratic Republic. 
Also, it has made extremely important 
provisions to ensure that the citizens get 
justice and their freedom is protected. The 
Indian Constitution is seen as the means 
through which a progressive developed 
society based on social justice and equality 
will be established.
The constitution came into force on 
26th January 1950 and since then the 
Government has been working in 
accordance with the principles of the 
constitution. In this chapter, we will take 
a brief overview of the wide-ranging 
nature of Indian democracy, important 
changes that have taken place in its 
political process and steps that have been 
taken to establish social justice and 
equality. This review will primarily focus 
on three areas (1) Democracy (2) Social 
Justice (3) Judicial System.    
Democracy
Political Maturity : Democracy does 
not merely imply a representative structure. 
The essence of representative system is to 
integrate the principles of democracy in 
actual practice. Once this is done, 
democracy becomes an integral part of 
the political life of the society.
Accordingly, the Indian people have 
direct representation in the Parliament, 
State legislature and local government. 
Holding free and fair elections at regular 
intervals is an important indicator of 
India’s successful democracy. The 
increasing participation of the people in 
the political process and political 
competition shows that Indian democracy 
has become successful to a great extent. 
Right to Vote : The Indian 
Constitution had made the provision of 
right to vote for adults. In the pre-
independence period several provisions 
existed which restricted the Right to Vote. 
All such provisions were cancelled after 
independence and the Indian constitution 
guaranteed adult suffrage by giving the 
right to vote equally, to both men and 
women above the age of 21 years.  The 
voting age was later reduced from 21 to 
18 which gave opportunity of political 
participation to the young generation in 
India.  Such provisions have made India 
the largest democracy in the world. India 
has the largest number of voters compared 
to any other democratic nation. This 
change is not only quantitative but also 
qualitative as new political parties are 
emerging with the active support of young 
voters. These parties represent various 
expectations of people and compete in the 
political sphere. 
Decentralisation of Democracy : 
Decentralisation of power is central to 
democratic government. Decentralisation 
controls the misuse of power and also 
creates opportunities for political

Right to Information (R.T.I.2005)  : 
Citizen empowerment is the essential 
condition of democracy. It is necessary to 
create opportunities for citizen’s 
participation and interaction with the 
government. Increased communication 
between citizens and government helps in 
strengthening democracy and in building 
a relationship of trust between them. 
Citizens have a right to know about the 
functioning of the government. The 
Government of India gave the Right to 
Information to the citizens of India to 
Social Justice and Equality
Social justice and equality are the 
important objectives of our constitution. 
The Constitution has given the guidelines 
participation for the common people. The 
Directive Principles of State Policy include 
the provisions for democratic 
decentralisation.  One such important 
provision is regarding empowering the 
local self-government make genuine 
democratic governance a reality. After 
independence, several attempts were made 
towards democratic decentralisation. One 
such important attempt is the 73rd and 
74th amendment to Indian Constitution; 
which gave a constitutional status to local 
self-governing institutions and also 
increased their powers. 
Can you tell the reasons for the 
following changes ?
 Some seats are kept reserved for 
women to increase their participation 
in political process.
 Some seats are kept reserved for 
weaker sections of the society so 
that they can get a share in political 
power.
 The State Election Commission has 
been established.
 The 11th and 12th schedule was 
added to the constitution.
ensure transparency and accountability 
which are the hallmarks of good 
governance. Right to Information has 
made the government more transparent 
and has reduced the element of secrecy 
in the working of government. 
After the year 2000, the whole 
approach towards democratic reforms has 
changed. Democratic reforms are 
considered as ‘rights’ of citizens. 
Accordingly, citizens in India have got 
Right to Information, education and food 
security. These rights have strengthened 
democracy in India.  
Discuss
Do you think that citizens in 
India should have the right to 
employment?
According to you, if everyone 
gets the right to shelter, how will it 
affect democracy in India ?
Rights based approach : In the 
decades after independence, progress 
was made towards more and more 
democratisation of India. However, 
in this process citizens were 
considered as beneficiaries. In the 
last few decades development is 
considered as the right of the citizens. 
In your opinion, how will this 
approach change the relations 
between the government and citizens?

to establish a new society based on these 
two values. We are following the path 
laid down by our Constitution to achieve 
this goal.  
To establish social justice is to 
remove those social conditions which are 
responsible for injustice and insist on the 
equality of dignity for all individuals. The 
principles of justice and equality aim at 
ending discrimination in social status such 
as superior or inferior on the basis of 
caste, religion, language and gender, 
place of birth, race, property and giving 
equality of opportunity for development to 
every individual. 
To establish justice and equality, 
efforts are to be made at all levels of 
society. But the government’s efforts and 
policies on this front are more important. 
For Democracy to be inclusive, one must 
try to bring all sections of the society into 
the mainstream. Democracy is in fact, a 
process of accommodating different 
sections in society.  Democracy helps in 
reducing social conflicts. Let us take 
review of the efforts made in India in this 
direction.
Policy of Reservation of seats : 
Policy of Reservation of seats is meant 
for those sections of society who have 
been deprived of the opportunities for 
education and employment for a long 
period of time. Accordingly, in educational 
institutions and in government services 
some seats are kept reserved for scheduled 
caste and scheduled tribes. There is also 
a provision of reservation of seats for 
other backward classes.
The Scheduled Castes and Tribes 
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act : This is 
an important Act for establishing social 
justice and equality. This act prevents 
any injustice against the people belonging 
Provisions for minorities : The 
Indian constitution has made several 
provisions for the protection of minorities. 
The government has adopted several 
policies for minorities to provide them the 
opportunities for education and 
employment. The Indian constitution 
prohibits discrimination on the basis of 
caste, religion, race, language and region. 
This is a comprehensive provision for 
minorities which fundamentally protects 
their right to equality, freedom, right 
against exploitation and cultural and 
educational rights. 
Laws relating to women and 
provisions for representation : In the 
post-independence period, efforts were 
made for empowering women. Taking 
into consideration the problems of women, 
several policies have been adopted at 
national and international level to remove 
illiteracy among women and to make 
available opportunities for their 
development.
The right to have an equal share in 
the property of the father and husband, 
Dowry Prohibition Act, act against sexual 
harassment, Domestic Violence Prohibition 
Act are some important provisions which 
create a favourable environment for 
protection of freedom of women and 
securing their development.

above law. Try to understand them

to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe 
and any act of atrocity committed against 
them is liable for punishment. 
72
In our country, from the very beginning, 
women have inadequate representation in 
politics and political institutions. Many 
countries in the world have made efforts to 
increase representation of women. From 
this perspective, changes are taking place 
in India as well. The 73rd and 74th 
amendment reserved 33% of seats for 
women in local self-governing institutions. 
This percentage has been raised to 50%in 
several states including Maharashtra. 
Role of Judiciary
The Judiciary in India has played an 
important role in strengthening democracy 
and helping to make towards achieving 
the objectives of social justice and 
equality. While interpreting the provisions 
of the constitution, the judiciary has

low in public life. If Family structure, 
social surrounding, economic sector, 
political sphere become more open, 
women will get a chance to participate 
in the decision making process that 
can provide a different direction to 
politics. For this purpose, women’s 
participation should be increased in 
the representative institutions.
always taken into consideration the 
fundamental objectives of the constitution 
and also the intentions of the constitution 
makers. We will try to understand the 
contribution of the judiciary in this regard 
with the help of following points.
The Representation of Women in Lok Sabha
73
(1) The basic framework of the 
constitution : The Constitution is dynamic. 
It is a living document. The Constitution 
has to change according to changing 
conditions and the Parliament has a 
power to make those changes. The 
Judiciary has accepted this power of the 
Parliament to make changes in the 
Constitution but at same time specified 
the limitations on this power. The Judiciary 
has taken a stand that the Parliament 
while amending the constitution cannot 
alter the basic structure of the constitution.
This is important to understand !
Democracy requires good 
governance or best governing 
practices. Following are the features 
of good governance. What should be 
done to bring good governance in 
democracy ?
 Accountable/responsible government
 Effective and efficient government
 Responsive government 
 Transparency in working of the 
government
  Just and all-inclusive development 
 People’s participation in the 
governing and decision-making 
process 
In this chapter, we took a review of 
the constitution and the working of the 
government on the basis of the constitution 
in the context of Indian democracy. There 
are many challenges before India’s 
democracy. Government’s acts and policies 
have not put an end to all the problems. 
There are several new problems confronting 
us. However what is important is that the 
people in India have developed a 
democratic mind-set.
In the next chapter we will study the 
election process in India.   
Please understand.
The basic structure of the 
constitution generally includes 
following provisions.
  Republican and democratic form of 
government
  Federal structure of the Constitution.
  Promotion of unity and integrity of 
the nation
  Sovereignty of the nation
  Secularism and supremacy of the 
constitution
(2) Significant judicial decisions : 
The protection provided to the citizens by 
fundamental rights in the constitution has 
been made more meaningful through 
various decisions of judiciary. Some of 
the important subjects on which the Court 
has given judgements include rights of 
children; protection of human rights; 
protection of the honour and dignity of 
women; individual freedom; and tribal 
empowerment. These efforts have made 
the political process in India more mature.
Please understand.

2. The Electoral Process
Elections have played a major role in 
the working of India’s democracy. 
Elections and representation are two very 
important processes in democracy. We 
know that people’s representatives are 
selected through elections. Elections help 
to bring a change in power through 
peaceful means. Different political parties 
get an opportunity to rule. Policies of the 
government and life of society also 
changes. We expect that the representatives 
we elect should be efficient, honest, and 
trustworthy and that they should respect 
the opinion of people.  The electoral 
process should also be free, fair and 
reliable. To ensure that, the Constitution 
of India has made provision for an 
independent Election Commission to 
administer the election process in India. 
The Election Commission of India 
and the State level State Election 
Commissions conduct all important 
elections in our country. The entire process 
of elections from declaring the date of 
elections to the declaration of results is 
carried out under the direction and control 
of Election Commission. The election 
process is an inseparable component of a 
comprehensive democratic process.
In this chapter we will understand the 
structure, functions and role of the Election 
Commission. We will also discuss the 
reforms required to be made in the 
electoral process. 
Election Commission
In India, the Election Commission is 
central to the process of elections. Art 
324 of the Indian Constitution has 
established this autonomous body which 
consists of one Chief Election 
Commissioner and two other 
commissioners. 
What is representation? Modern 
democracy is a representative 
democracy. In a democracy it is not 
possible to involve the entire 
population in the decision-making 
process. This resulted in the starting 
of the practice of electing some 
people on behalf of entire population 
as representatives who would run 
the government. The representatives 
who form the government are 
expected to be responsible to the 
people and give preference to the 
welfare of the people.

Sukumar Sen 
Sukumar Sen was the first chief 
election commissioner after independence. 
In 1921, Sen was 
selected for Indian 
Civil Services under 
the British rule. He 
was given the charge 
of the Election 
Commissioner after 
the Election 
Commission was 
established in 1950. 
Mr. Sen efficiently 
handled the responsibility of the Election 
Commission in extremely adverse 
conditions.

Can you tell ?
What criteria are laid down by the 
Election Commission for giving 
recognition to political parties ?
The President appoints the election 
commissioners. The Chief Election 
Commissioner cannot be removed from his 
post easily or on account of any political 
reasons. This is necessary so as to preserve 
the independence of election commission. 
There is a separate provision made for the 
expenses of Election Commission. 
The Election Commission does not 
have a separate staff. Government officers, 
teachers and other employees help the 
Election Commission to execute the 
process of elections.
 When candidates have only the 
condition of age as eligibility, why 
should they give other information 
to election commission ?
 Why are the candidates required to 
give the information of their property 
to Election Commission ?
Why is it required ?
(2) Decide the timetable and the 
programme of elections : The conduct 
of elections is entirely the responsibility 
of the Election Commission. The Election 
Commission decides when to conduct 
elections and in how many stages to hold 
elections in every state. 
(3) Scrutiny of the applications of 
candidates : After the election dates are 
declared, every political party selects the 
candidates to contest elections. Some 
candidates contest the elections 
independently without the support of any 
political party. Candidates of political 
parties as well as independent candidates 
have to fill the applications which include 
the information about their own self. The 
Election Commission scrutinises all the 
applications and allows the eligible 
candidates to contest the elections. 
(4) Give recognition to political 
parties : We have a multiparty system in 
our country. New parties continue to be 
Special campaign to create 
awareness among voters is run for 
voter’s registration. The National Voter’s 
Day is celebrated for the purpose.

Functions of Election Commission
(1) Preparing the voters list : Every 
Indian citizen who has completed 18 
years of age has a right to vote. To 
exercise the right to vote, citizen’s name 
must be in the voters list. It is the 
responsibility of the Election Commission 
to prepare the list of eligible voters, 
update the existing voter’s list and include 
the names of new voters. The Election 
Commission has the authority to issue 
identity cards to the voters. 
 Some constituencies are kept 
reserved for Scheduled caste and 
Scheduled tribes.
 Every political party has an election 
symbol.
 At the time of voting and counting 
of votes, the official representatives 
of political parties remain present.
 Recognised parties have equal 
opportunity to present their side 
before media such as television and 
radio. 
Why is it so ?

formed. Spilt in the parties results in the 
formation of new parties. All political 
parties are required to be recognised by 
the Election Commission. Election 
Commission also has a right to derecognise 
any political party. The Election 
Commission also allots election symbols 
to the political parties. 
(5) To resolve any disputes relating 
to elections : The Election Commission 
Which two conditions among 
following is the violation of code of 
conduct?
* The candidate distributes items of 
household use.
* Promise made to resolve the water 
problem if elected.
* To go from door to door to meet 
voters and request them to vote.
* To appeal on the basis of caste and 
religion to get support.
Which of these rules would you 
include in the code of conduct for 
voters?
Sham Sharan 
Negi from 
Himachal Pradesh 
was the first voter 
of India. He 
exercised his right 
to vote on 25th 
Remember this.
Who is superior ? 
the Government 
or the Election 
Commission?
has the responsibility of resolving any 
disputes that may arise regarding elections. 
Accordingly, to declare any candidate as 
disqualified or conduct re-election in a 
particular constituency is the responsibility 
of the Election Commission. 
What will you do ?
Voting is our duty as well as a 
responsibility.
Government has to 
observe the code of 
conduct declared by the 
Election commission. 
October 1951 in Loksabha Elections.
78
Restructuring of the Constituency : 
The total number of members in Loksabha 
is 543.  How are these members elected? 
Every member represents one constituency. 
It means there are 543 constituencies of 
Loksabha. Creating constituencies is the 
responsibility of the Delimitation 
Commission of Election Commission. The 
Delimitation Commission does not 
succumb to any pressure while restructuring 
the constituencies.
What is a code of conduct ?
To ensure free and fair elections in 
India, the Election Commission has 
adopted several measures. The Code of 
Conduct is one of the measures adopted 
by the Election Commission.  In the last 
few decades, the Election Commission 
has used its powers to control malpractices 
during elections. The Code of Conduct 
explains the rules that are to be followed 
by the Government, political parties and 
voters before elections and during elections. 
Even the Government cannot violate these 
rules. Due to the strict observance of the 
code of conduct in the last few elections, 
the common voters have become confident. 
Challenges in conducting free and 
fair elections : If we take into account 
the size of our country and the number 
of voters, conducting elections becomes a 
truly challenging task. The Election 
Commission has to work in accordance 
with the law while dealing with these 
challenges. Some of the challenges are 
mentioned below :
 Misuse of money takes place to a 
great extent during elections. The 
Election Commission has to take 
several measures to stop such a misuse 
of money. 
 Many political parties give election 
tickets to the candidates with criminal 
background. This results not only in 
criminalisation of politics but the 
Election Commission also faces 
problems in ensuring that elections are 
conducted in free environment. 
 Another major challenge is violence 
during elections. The extent of violence 
has increased significantly during 
At the time of first elections, 
preparing the voter’s list was a 
challenging task. As many people 
were illiterate, the special procedure 
of voting was used during elections. 
20 lacs steel boxes were made for 
voting purpose.  Election symbols 
were stuck on the boxes.  The voters 
were given the blank ballot papers 
which they were supposed to drop in 
the box having the election symbol of 
the party they wanted to vote for. 
This system ensured that even the 
illiterate people could vote.

Think.
 How political parties suffer due 
to family monopoly in the party ?
 What do you understand by the 
system of ‘one vote one value’ ? 
 To increase participation of women in 
politics, the political parties should 
give 50% candidature to women 
candidates and try to ensure that they 
get elected.
 Political parties should not give 
candidature to candidates having 
criminal background. They should 
strictly follow the decision given by 
courts in this respect.
 The Government should take care of 
election expenses. To ensure that 
parties will not make misuse of money 
and mismanagement of money during 
elections can be stopped.
 Representation of the Peoples Act 
should be amended so that candidates 
having criminal background would not 
be able to participate in elections. 
Electoral reforms : Elections is a 
continuous process. The future of 
democracy depends on elections. Electoral 
process becomes reliable if election 
process gets improved. Some reforms are 
suggested below. What will be its effects 
according to you ? 
The first election in 
independent India was held in 
1951-52. This was the beginning 
of shaping of democracy 
through electoral politics. In the 
initial elections ballot boxes 
were used for the purpose of 
voting. The use of EVM 
machines started from the 
decade of 1990s. Many things 
could be achieved because of 
voting machine. If the voters 
do not want to vote for any 
candidate, they could choose an 
option of ‘None of the above’ 
Journey from ballot boxes to EVM machines
elections. All political parties should 
help The Election Commission to 
control this violence. 
 To retain a continuing influence on 
politics, leaders give election tickets to 
their own relatives. This practice 
creates a family monopoly in politics.
– (NOTA). This option can be given only 
because of the voting machine. It has become 
easy for disabled people (Divyanga) to vote. 
It reduced the cutting of trees for paper and 
thereby helped in the protection of 
environment. It has also been possible to 
have an early declaration of election results. 
80
Do you know ?
Election Commission established 
an expert committee on 8th October 
2010. It was decided to add a new 
facility – Voter Verified Paper Audit 
Trail in EVM machines. All political 
parties supported this. Because of 
this facility the voters can verify 
whether the vote cast is registered 
properly. The purpose of this 
important step is to stop malpractices 
in elections. 
Please understand.
General elections : Loksabha 
elections held after every five years 
are called general elections.  
Midterm elections : If the elected 
government loses its majority before 
completing its term in the Parliament 
or if the parties of the coalition 
government withdraw their support 
resulting in the loss of majority support 
for the government and if no alternative 
government is possible, then elections 
are held before the completion of the 
term. They are called midterm elections. 
By-elections : If an elected 
representative in Loksabha, 
Vidhansabha or the local self-
government resigns or due to his/her 
death his seat becomes vacant, the 
elections are held for that vacant seat. 
This is called a by-election.  
In this chapter we studied the electoral 
process from various angles. In the next 
chapter we will study the political parties 
in India.

In the last chapter we studied the 
working of constitution and election 
procedure. Political parties are a link that 
connects common people, democracy, 
representation and elections. Whatever we 
read or hear about politics is related to 
political parties. Political parties exist in 
all democratic systems. In fact political 
parties compete with each other only in 
a democracy. In this chapter we will 
study the political party system in India. 
In your school and the surroundings 
you must have seen some groups, 
institutions, organisations working to 
achieve some objective. Some 
organisations take initiative in resolving 
social problems. You may have read 
about the various movements and their 
work. Just as there are active groups, 
institutions and movements, similarly 
there are political parties who contest 
elections. Political parties are also a kind 
of social organisations, but there is a 
difference between political parties and 
other institutions and organisations in 
society. The difference is in the goals and 
style of working of political parties and 
other organisations. On this background, 
we can say that when people form 
organisations with the objective of 
achieving political power and participate 
in the electoral process, such organisations 
are called political parties. Political parties 
thus can be described as a group of 
people who aim to contest elections, win 
elections and get power and establish the 
government of their party. 
Following are some important 
characteristics of political parties :
To be in power : Achieving power 
through elections is the main objective of 
political parties. Thus different political 
parties compete with each other to get 
power. There is nothing wrong in this 
competition, but the competition should 
be fair.
To pursue an ideology : Every 
political party has some policies and world 
views. Parties have a particular stand 
about social issues. These together make 
party ideology. The people who consider 
any specific party ideology as acceptable 
support that political party. Social support 
received by a political party is called the 
‘mass base’ of political party.  In modern 
days ideologies of all political parties 
appear to be similar hence it has become 
difficult to differentiate between the parties 
on the basis of ideologies. 
To have a Party Agenda : Political 
parties prepare their party’s agenda on 
the basis of party ideology. They 
implement the agenda after they get 
political power. Even if they do not get 
political power, political parties try to get 
support of people on the basis of this 
agenda.
To Establish a Government : 
Political parties establish the government 
and govern the nation. The political party 
which gets majority in elections forms the 
government. The parties which do not get 
majority act as opposition parties. 
To act as a link between the 
Government and the people : Political 
parties work as a link between the

Changing nature of political party 
system in India : 
(1) The Congress was a strong 
political party in the post-independence 
period. Congress had a majority at Centre 
and in most of the States.  Indian politics 
was controlled by the Congress Party. 
This era was described as Era of ‘Single 
dominant party system’.
(2) The non-Congress parties came 
together and challenged ‘Single dominant 
party system’ in 1977.
Imagine you are an opposition 
party leader and you have observed 
that the ruling party has not done 
good work in the field of health. 
What will you do as a leader of 
opposition ?
What do you understand by the 
following news in newspapers? 
Explain in brief
 Opposition parties held a meeting in 
Mumbai to resist the Ruling party. 
Will take up the issue of farmers ?
 Ruling party organised ‘Samvad 
Yatra’ in rural areas.
Think and write.
Mahatma Gandhi, Vinoba  Bhave 
and Jayprakash Narayan put forth 
the idea of partyless democracy. 
What has to be done to bring 
such democracy in modern times?
 If power remains with one 
political party for a long period 
and if no other political parties 
are influential - the party system 
is called as one party system
 In politics, when two political 
parties are influential and if 
political parties enjoy power 
alternatively, the party system 
is called two party system
 When many political parties 
compete for political power and 
more or less they are equally 
influential, the party system is 
called multi-party system.
Do you know ?
(3) After the 1989 Loksabha Elections, 
the system of one party emerging as 
dominant party came to an end. Since 
then different parties began to come 
together to form coalition governments. 
Both the Bharatiya Janata Party and 
Congress Party made an experiment of 
establishing coalition governments. The 
belief that coalition government brings 
instability was proved wrong by the 
political party system in our country. In 
fact, the coalition government system as 
stabilised in India.

National Parties
(Reference : Election Commission of India, 
Notification No.56/201/PPS-111, dated 13 
December 2016)
(1) Indian National Congress : The 
Indian National Congress was established 
in 1885. At the time of its establishment, 
Congress was an all comprehensive 
movement working for national 
independence. Groups with different 
ideologies had come together in this 
nationalist movement. 
After independence 
the Congress emerged 
as the most dominant 
political party. The 
party, from the 
beginning, follows 
the policy of 
secularism, all round development, equal 
rights and welfare for minorities and 
disadvantageous sections of the society. 
Accordingly, Congress has organised 
various programmes to achieve those 
objectives. The party believes in 
democratic socialism, social equality and 
international peace.
(2) Communist Party of India : This 
party based on the 
communist ideology 
was established in 
1925. It is an old 
party in India. This 
party works for the 
welfare of labourers and workers. The 
party opposes capitalism. The party 
leadership developed differences in 1962 
over the issue of whether Communist 
Party of India should accept the leadership 
of Communist China or the Soviet Union. 
This led to the split in Communist Party 
of India and a separate party – Communist 
Party of India (Marxist) was formed.
Also understand
The national parties and the 
regional parties.
To get recognition as a national 
party, the Election Commission has 
prescribed the following conditions:
(a) A political party should secure 
minimum 6% of the valid votes 
in four or more States in the 
earlier Loksabha or State 
Assembly elections and minimum 
4 members should be elected in 
the Loksabha from any state or 
states in the earlier elections.
Or
(b) The candidates of a party should 
be elected from minimum 2% 
constituencies out of total 
Loksabha constituencies and 
from minimum 3 states.
To get recognition as a regional 
party, the Election Commission has 
prescribed the following conditions   :
(a) A political party should secure 
minimum 6% of the valid votes 
in the earlier Loksabha or State 
Assembly elections and minimum 
2 members should be elected in 
the Vidhan Sabha  (State 
Assembly).
Or
(b) A political party should secure 
minimum 3% of seats out of 
total seats of Vidhansabha – 
(State Assembly) or minimum 3 
seats.
Let us know about some important 
political parties in India.
85
(3) Bharatiya Janata Party : 
Bharatiya Janata Party is an important 
party at the national level. Bharatiya Jan 
Sangh was established in 
1951. This party was 
merged with Janata Party 
that was established in 
1977. The Janata Party 
could not survive. There 
was a split in the party 
and Bharatiya Jan Sangh - the component 
party of Janata Party established a new 
party in 1980 - Bharatiya Janata Party. 
The party stands for the protection of 
Indian culture and traditions.  The party 
gives importance to economic reforms. 
(4) Communist Party of India 
(Marxist) : This party 
proclaims socialism, 
secularism and 
democracy. The party 
opposes imperialism. 
Party’s policy is to 
protect the interests of 
workers, farmers and 
landless labourers.   
(5) Bahujan Samaj Party : Bahujan 
Samaj Party professes the Socialist 
ideology. In 1984 the 
party was established 
with the objective of 
protecting the interest 
of the ‘majority’. 
Scheduled caste, 
scheduled tribes, 
religious minorities 
and other backward classes together 
constitute a majority.  The party aims to 
give power in the hands of the ‘majority’.
(6) Nationalist Congress Party : In 
1999, there was a split in the Congress 
Party and Nationalist Congress Party was 
established. The party 
believes in the values 
of democracy, equality 
and secularism. The 
party was in power in 
Maharashtra from 
1999 to 2014 in 
coalition with the 
Congress Party.  Nationalist Congress 
Party for a long period was also a part 
of coalition government led by Congress 
at Centre from 2004 to 2014.
(7) Trinamool Congress : All India 
Trinamool Congress 
Party was established 
in 1998. Election 
Commission gave the

You must be reading different news 
in newspapers. Through these news items 
we get information about various parties 
existing in different states of India. 
 Do these parties function only at State 
level ?
 Some state leaders are influential at 
national level, while some have 
influence only at state level. Why is it 
so ?
With the help of such questions we 
will try to get information about various 
regional parties in India.  We will study 
some of the regional parties from different 
parts of India. 
In India we find people speaking 
different languages and having different 
traditions and culture. They belong to 
different parts of India. We see different 
regions have their own language. You 
have already studied different geographical 
regions in Maharashtra. In Maharashtra 
there exists geographical and cultural 
diversity. Maharashtra is different from 
Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. 
The feeling of affinity developed 
about our language and region gradually 
turns into the identity consciousness and 
finally gives rise to regionalism. People 
start thinking primarily about the interest 
and development of their own region. 
They start feeling proud of their language, 
literature, traditions, history of social 
reforms, educational and cultural 
movements and this gives rise to the 
development of linguistic identity. Regional 
identity develops from the consciousness 
about the development of region and the 
feeling that people belonging to the region 
should have claim over resources and 
employment opportunities.
When linguistic, regional, cultural and 
other identities get connected, regional 
consciousness emerges as a stronger 
feeling. Sometimes it gives rise to 
independent political parties or pressure 
groups or movements. All such 
developments aim at the protection of the 
interests of region. 
Regional Parties
Regional parties are those groups in 
the region who have a proud feeling 
about the different identity of their region 
and who compete to get political power 
with the objective of regional development. 
The influence of regional parties is limited 
to a particular region. Though they play 
a significant role at the regional level, 
they influence national politics as well.

Objective – protection of the rights of 
Marathi people, promotion of Marathi 
Language, resistance to people from other 
regions.

BJP and came to power in Maharashtra. It 
shares power with the BJP in Maharashtra 
since 2014.
resolution of regional problems.  For the 
development of the region they demand 
more autonomy and authority.  Though 
they cooperate with federal government, 
they try to protect their autonomy. 
Regional parties make several 
demands such as regional problems should 
be resolved at regional level; political 
power should be in the hands of the 
people from region and residents of the 
region should get preference in 
administration and jobs. 
Changing nature of regional parties 
in India : Regional parties came into 
existence in India in the post independent 
period. However, over the years their 
nature and role has changed significantly. 
(1) Initially regional identities gave 
rise to the separatist movements. The 
demands for independent Khalistan, 
Dravidistan were made with the objective 
of parting from the Indian federation and 
exist as an independent State. Regional 
parties from Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and 
Jammu and Kashmir have made such 
demands.
(2) The demands of regional parties 
gradually changed. Instead of an 
independent state, they started demanding 
more autonomy. This was the second 
stage in the development of regional 
parties. This stage began after 1990.
(3) The regional parties demanded 
that for the development of the region, 
people from region should get power at 
State and national level. For example, 
Shiv Sena, Telugu Desam, etc.
(4) The development of regional 
parties in North East shows a different 
trend. They gave up their demand of 
separatism and have started demanding 
autonomy. The regional parties from 
North East are now entering in mainstream 
of national politics. 
In short we can say that role of 
regional parties in India has passed 
through various phases - from separatism 
to autonomy and now towards entry into 
mainstream national politics. Coalition 
politics is one of the consequence of their 
increasing influence in national politics.
In India we have many regional 
parties. It is not possible to know about 
all such parties in this chapter. We will 
study some parties as representative of 
India’s East, West, North and South 
regions.

Justice Party - a non Brahmin movement in 1920 
was transformed into Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam – a 
political party. In 1944, Justice party came to be known 
as Dravida Kazhagam. In 1944, a group separated from 
this party and established another party-Dravida Munnetra

In this chapter we took a review of 
national and regional political parties in 
India. In the next chapter we will try to

movements in our life. 
Every State in India has regional 
parties. It is not possible to take 
review of all those parties. Find out

4. Social and Political Movements
Read out the news in a local newspaper. labourers, businessmen, women, youth, 
and senior citizens. 
Why movements ?
All the people in the society cannot 
participate in political parties and 
contribute to social welfare. Some people 
focus on a particular issue and persue it. 
They organise people and try to pressurise 
the government to resolve that issue. They 
constantly follow up on the issue, build 
public opinion about it and thereby put a 
pressure on political parties and the 
government. This type of organised 
activity is called a movement. Organised 
activity is the essence of any movement. 
Such movements are very important 
in a democracy. Different social problems 
come under discussion through these 
movements. The government then has to 
pay attention to such problems. Leaders 
and activists of the movement provide 
necessary information about those issues 
to the government. This information is 
very useful for the government while 
making policies. 
Some movements aim at opposing a 
particular decision or policy of the 
government. The right to protest is 
considered an important right in 
democracy. However this right needs to 
be used patiently and responsibly. 
 In the above newspaper item different 
movements are included. Can you 
explain their meaning  ?
 This news deals with different subjects. 
Are movements related to only one 
issue ? 
 If different movements cooperate with 
each other will they be more effective ?
In the last chapter we got information 
about the national and regional parties. 
Political parties compete for political 
power. They win elections and try to 
resolve the problems of the common men. 
Political parties generally adopt a 
comprehensive perspective. They cannot 
concentrate on just one particular issue. 
From public cleanliness to space research, 
they have to take into consideration all 
matters from national perspective and 
take decisions. Political parties are 
expected to have a programme for the 
problems of all sections of the society. 
Political parties adopt policies taking into 
consideration the interests of all - farmers, 
Movement against child marriage 
has been successful to a great extent 
and the extent of child marriages have 
reduced by 50%. The workers in this 
movement worked very consciously. 
Workers from the movement 
against dowry also helped them. Now 
there is a need to start a drive against 
malnutrition, because poverty and 
malnutrition are two important 
problems to be taken on priority basis.
Which movements in India are 
actively working for rehabilitation of 
the displaced and to secure their 
livelihood  ?
Can you tell ?
92
What is a movement ?
 A Movement is a collective action. 
People’s active participation is expected 
in the movement.
 A Movement can be formed when 
people come together in the interest of a 
particular issue, for eg. Pollution can be 
a single issue for which a movement can 
be created.
 A movement has a particular social 
objective or a focussed problem. For eg. 
Movement against corruption aims at 
ending corruption.
 Movements have a leadership. 
Leadership keeps the movement active. 
Objectives of the movement, programme 
of action, strategy of agitation are decided 
by its leaders. A strong leadership makes 
movement effective.
 Movements have organisations. 
Discuss.
Generally the movements are 
devoted to one particular issue but 
have an ideology behind them. For 
example movements against child 
marriage, dowry believe in values of 
democracy, women empowerment 
and social equality. Sometimes some 
movements gradually get transformed 
into political parties.
Without an organisation, it becomes 
difficult to follow up the issues. For eg. 
Farmer’s organisation works for farmer’s 
movement.
 Any movement requires public 
support. People should feel connected to 
the issue that is undertaken by the 
movement. Movements have a programme 
of action which help them to shape public 
opinion.
Read the following dialogue and write a paragraph on it.
If the human rights 
movement becomes 
influential worldwide, there 
is no need for other 
movements.
But the problems in 
developing countries are of 
different nature. Different 
social, economic and cultural 
conditions may give rise to 
different movements.
Movements were 
supressed during the 
British period. But in 
democratic system 
existence of movements 
is an indicator of 
healthy democratic system.
It’s true. Otherwise 
we would not have 
said – ‘save girls’
We can get an 
experience of 
movement here itself. 
Can we start a 
movement to make the 
school surrounding 
safe for girls?

 Which movement in India led to the 
filing of Public Interest Litigation and 
the Judiciary had to give decision 
over PIL ?
 Name the movements started by 
Mahatma Gandhi, Mahatma Phule, 
Sant Gadge Maharaj, and 
Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Can you tell ?
 Civic problems need not originate 
only in the social sphere. They can 
emerge from any section of the 
society. In India, especially in 
Maharashtra, many social reform 
movements were started and society 
started getting modernised. 
 Our struggle for independence was 
also a social movement. 
 The issues like protecting rights of 
the citizens, right to vote, minimum 
wages, and economic security are 
the focus of political and economic 
movements.   Swadeshi movement 
is an important economic movement.

Important movements in India
Tribal movement : In the 
pre-independence period, the British 
government deprived tribal people of their 
right to livelihood on 
forest resources. 
There was a Tribal 
uprising in Kolam 
from Chota Nagpur, 
Gond from Orissa, 
Koli, Bhilla and 
Ramoshi from 
Maharashtra, Santhal 
and Munda from 
Bihar. The tribal struggle has continued 
since those years. Tribals in India face 
several problems. One major problem is 
that they are denied right over forests. 
The main demand of the tribal movement 
is to accept their right over forests. They 
should be allowed to collect products of 
forests and also should have a right to 
cultivate on forest land. 
Farmers movement in India : 
Farmers movement in India is an important 
movement. During the British period, 
farmers started getting organised due to 
anti-agriculture policies of the British 
colonial government. You must be aware 
of farmers movements in Bardoli, 
Champaranya and movements against 
revenue collection. The farmers movements 
were inspired by the thoughts of Mahatma 
Phule, Justice Ranade and Mahatma 
Gandhi.
Due to some reforms in agriculture 
(tenancy laws, laws relating to tilting of 
the land etc) the farmers movement 
slowed down. After the Green Revolution, 
the farmers movement became more 
active and effective. Though Green 
Revolution aimed at increasing agricultural 
production and achieving self-sufficiency 
Collect the news in the newspapers 
about the movements such as 
Andhashraddha Nirmulan Movement, 
movement to stop the pollution of 
rivers, movement against female 
foeticide, Not in My Name, etc.

In 1960s and 1970s trade Union movement 
organised several agitations. But from 
1980s trade union movement started 
getting disintegrated. Globalisation has 
affected the trade union movement to a 
great extent. 
In India, workers are facing different 
problems. Unstable employment conditions, 
contract labour, financial insecurity, 
absence of legal protection for workers, 
unlimited working hours, insecurity at the 
workplace, health hazards are some of 
the problems.  
Women’s movement : In the pre-
independence period, progressive men in 
India initiated the 
women’s movement. The 
women’s movement 
aimed at eliminating 
injustice against women 
and ending their 
exploitation, help them 
to lead a respectful life 
and participate actively 
in social life. 
Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, Raja 
Rammohan Roy, Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, 
Savitribai Phule, Maharshee Dhondo 
Keshav Karve, Pandita Ramabai, Ramabai 
Ranade took initiative 
in ending the practice 
of Sati and child 
marriages. Reforms 
such as widow 
remarriage, women 
education and right to 
vote to women were 
possible due to the 
work of these reformists. After 
independence, the Constitution gave equal 
rights to women in all fields.  In spite of 
this women were not treated equally in 
several fields. During this period women’s

Trade Unions : Trade union in India 
emerged in the background of 
industrialisation. Textile industry, railway 
companies were established in India in 
the latter half of the nineteenth century. 
In 1899 railway workers went on strike 
for their demands. However, the first 
organisation for resolving the issues of 
workers was established in 1920. This 
organisation is known as All India Trade 
Union Congress. 
In the post-independence period Trade 
Unions started working more effectively. 
In the beginning of the 19th 
century industries like textile mills, 
Railway Company were started in 
India. Trade union movement in 
India has the background of this 
industrialisation. 
in food grains, it did not benefit the poor 
farmers. The farmers were now divided 
into rich farmers and poor farmers. 
Dissatisfaction among the poor farmers 
led to the beginning of farmer’s movement. 
Appropriate price for agricultural 
products, agriculture to be treated as an 
industry, implementation of the 
recommendations of the Swaminathan 
Commission, debt relief, debt cancellation, 
national policy for agriculture are some 
of the demands of the farmers movement. 
Shetkari Sanghatana, Bharatiya Kisan 
Union, All India Kisan Sabha are some 
of the important farmers organisations in 
India.

revival of rivers, forest conservation, 
and wild life conservation. His social 
movement is active for last 31 years. 
He won the Stockholm Water Prize, 
an award known as the ‘Nobel Prize 
for water’. 
movement aimed at freedom of women. 
The movement demanded that the women 
should be treated as human beings. 
In the latter period, women participated 
to a great extent in the movements against 
corruption, caste discrimination and 
religious extremism which made them 
aware of injustice against their own 
selves. Women started taking initiative in 
Organising against injustice. In India 
women’s movement is not homogeneous 
in nature. However women’s movements 
at various levels are taking up the issues 
like women’s health, social security, 
financial independence, and empowerment. 
Today women’s movement face the 
challenge of equal education for women 
and giving women a status and prestige 
as human beings. 
Environment movements : We are 
aware that environmental degradation is 
a serious problem at national and 
international level. At the international 
level several movements are working to 
stop the deterioration of the environment. 
We see a significant international 
cooperation in this field. 
In India many movements are working 
on differenet aspects of enviornment. The 
environment movements are taking up 
issues like protection of bio-diversity, 
protecting different 
sources of water, 
protection of forests, 
green belt, pollution 
of rivers, use of 
chemicals and their 
ill effects etc. 
Consumer movement : Consumer 
movement emerged in India after the 
Consumer Protection Act came into 
existence in 1986.  This movement has a 
broad objective. The movement believes 
that each member of the society is a 
consumer. Due to the changing nature of 
social and economic system consumers 
face different problems. Adulteration, 
increased cost of items, frauds in weight

The consumer movement works to protect 
consumers from such type of frauds. 
The movements increase the 
participation of people in public life.  The 
post 1980 movements are called neo-
social movements as their nature is 
different from the earlier movements. 
These movements are issue-based. It 
means they try to organise issue based 
mass movements. 
In the next chapter we will study 
challenges before democracy. 
Exercise
97
As we have said earlier, democracy 
is a continuous living process.  Mere 
adoption of democracy does not bring 
democracy into practice. Alert and 
conscious efforts are required to sustain 
democracy. It is necessary to understand 
threats to democracy in time and deal 
with them in a democratic manner. In this 
chapter we will primarily focus on 
challenges before democracy in India. But 
before that let us have a look at challenges 
before democracy at the global level.   
 Today every nation in the world 
claims to be democratic. But in reality 
very few nations in the world have 
democracy that protects the rights and 
freedom of people and gives priority to 
the welfare of people. Many democracies 
are facing the challenge of military take 
over. Spread of democratic values at the 
global level and adoption of true 
democracy by all nations is a major 
challenge at global level.
inclusion of all social components, 
autonomy to social institutions, 
empowerment of citizens, protection of 
human values need to be adopted for real 
cultivation of democracy. 
 Another challenge before democratic 
nations is to ensure that democracy 
becomes deep rooted. Freedom, equality, 
fraternity and justice, peace, development 
and humanitarianism are the values that 
should be practiced at all levels of the 
society. The mass support for this purpose 
can be gathered only through democratic 
means.  
Challenges before Indian Democracy
To make democracy more meaningful 
the government of India decentralised 
power and adopted the policy of 
reservation for women and weaker sections 
of the society. But we should think 
whether such measures really gave power 
in the hands of citizens?
Which democratic institutions need 
to be established for transformation 
from non-democratic system to a 
democratic system ?
Questions in my mind
China adopted economic reforms 
and also became a member of the 
World Trade Organisation. But China 
continues to have a one party system. 
Is China a democratic nation ?
5. Challenges faced by Indian Democracy
 Democratic values are found to be 
very weak even in those nations where 
democracy appears to be deep-rooted. In 
nations like India, democracy appears in 
the form of voting, elections, governmental 
structure, judiciary etc. However this is 
only a political form of democracy.  To 
become a way of life democracy must be 
practiced in each and every aspect of 
social life. Several measures such as 
In democracy, to get power, political 
parties contest elections. But do political 
parties organise internal elections ? It is 
necessary that political parties should 
hold elections at the organisational 
level. Are such elections held ?
Can you tell ?
98
Communalism and terrorism : 
Religious conflict and the resultant 
terrorism is one of the major challenges 
before Indian democracy. Social stability 
gets hampered due to increasing religious 
hostility. People’s participation in 
democratic process reduces to a great 
extent due to terrorism.
Left extremists - Naxalism : Naxalism 
is a major problem in India. Naxalism 
began as a movement to remove injustice 
against aggressive landless farmers and 
tribal people. But today Naxalism has 
become a violent struggle. In the Naxalite 
movement the importance of the problems 
of farmers and tribal people has reduced. 
Instead, violent measures to oppose the 
government policies, attacking the police 
forces and such other tactics are used by 
the Naxalite groups.
Corruption : In India the extent of 
corruption is  said to be very high in the 
public sector. Government’s working 
capacity is reduced due to corruption at 
the political and administrative levels. 
People develop distrust and dissatisfaction 
about the entire governmental system due 
to delay in governmental work, poor public 
services and facilities and different 
financial blunders. Corruption in the 
electoral process, bogus voting, bribing the 
voters, abducting the voters and such other 
things reduces people’s confidence in the 
democratic process.
process is another serious problem for 
democratic systems. Sometimes political 
parties give candidature to people having 
a criminal background, facing  criminal 
allegations and allegations of corruption. 
This increases the role of money and 
muscle power in politics. This may also 
lead to violence during elections. 
Social challenges : Apart from the 
challenges mentioned above, Indian 
democracy faces other social challenges. 
The problems like unemployment, unequal 
distribution of resources, increasing gap 
between rich and poor, caste based issues, 
need to be resolved.
What steps should be taken to make 
Indian Democracy successful?
(1) Majority opinion has a lot of 
importance in Democracy. In a democracy, 
Political party getting majority of votes 
comes to power. Parliament takes all 
decisions by majority. Democracy aims at 
the welfare of majority of people. When 
the importance is given to majority it is 
possible that injustice may be done to 
those who are marginal and who are in 
minority. Though democracy is a 
government by majority, minorities should 
also be included in the process of decision- 
making. It is the duty of government to 
take into consideration the interests of 
minorities. In short, in democratic 
government everyone’s opinion should be 
considered important. Similarly majority 
government should not be the government 
of majority community. All religious, 
linguistic, ethnic and caste groups should 
get equal opportunity to participate in the 
decision-making process. 
(2) Judiciary in India is seen to be 
making conscious efforts to make political 
process transparent. To prevent 
criminalisation of politics, judiciary has 
adopted measures like strict punishment 
What do you think ?
Family monopoly in politics is a major 
problem before democracy in India. 
Monopoly of just one family in politics 
reduces democratic space. Common people 
cannot participate in the public sector. 
Criminalisation of politics : Increased 
participation of criminals in political 
99
to criminals and prohibiting criminals 
from participating in political process.
(3) To make democracy successful in 
India, it is not just sufficient to make 
efforts at the level of government, 
administration and judiciary. Everyone at 
social and individual level should make 
conscious efforts towards it. Education for 
All campaign, Clean Bharat campaign, 
Gram Samruddhi Yojana, Self-help 
Groups, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural 
Employment Guarantee Scheme and such 
other projects are undertaken at the level 
of Government and Administration. To 
increase political participation of women, 
50% seats are kept reserved in local self-
governing institutions. 
(4) To make Indian democracy truly 
successful, it is essential to increase 
participation of people at all levels. If 
such participation increases especially at 
the level of the government it will help 
in changing public policies. Public polices 
are made through interaction with the 
people. Interaction with those who are not 
in power is also important for the success 
of democracy. 
The values of equality, liberty, social 
justice, secularism should be respected 
and implemented even in our personal 
life. For the success of democracy, 
everyone should keep in mind that we are 
responsible citizens of the nation.

Study about Political Science...
Every citizen in India, whether he lives in village, district or in 
city has to face numerous social and political problems every day. 
Whom to approach to get domicile certificate, caste certificate, Aadhar 
Card ? Whom should we meet ?  Regarding water problems, public 
cleanliness ? From where can we get documents about our house, 
etc.  ?
We can get to know about all such things from the study of 
Civics and Political Science. This study helps us to become a good 
citizen and to be aware of our rights and duties as a citizen of this 
country.  This subject also helps us to get information of India and 
also the outside world. 
The subject of Political Science will also help you when you plan 
for your future after finishing your school education. The subject of 
Indian government and politics is included in the syllabus of the 
examination for Union Public Service Commission, Maharashtra 
Public Service Commission and recruitment in banking services. 
Political science is the basis of any field you choose as a profession. 
Similarly we cannot study international politics, public administration, 
peace and conflict without studying political science. Many employment 
opportunities are available in the above fields. Opportunities are 
available not only in the field of teaching and research but 
opportunities are also available in the fields of information technology, 
policy analysis and advisory bodies of political leaders. 
Globalisation has created many opportunities for the practical use 
of political science. Political parties, pressure groups, non-governmental 
organisations, voluntary organisations need researchers and mediators 
who have the knowledge of government and politics. In today’s world 
people having knowledge of the political process and complexities of 
bureaucracy and special knowledge skills are essential.
